CHAOS SPACE MARINES
ARMY RULES

Beseeching the Chaos Gods with fanatical fervour, 
the profane champions of the Heretic Astartes pray 
for diabolic boons, promising the vilest of offerings in 
return for their power.

DARK PACTS
If your Army Faction is Heretic Astartes, each time a 
unit with this ability is selected to shoot or fight, it can 
make a Dark Pact. If it does, select one of the following 
abilities for that unit’s weapons to gain until the end 
of the phase:

 ■ [LETHAL HITS]
 ■ [SUSTAINED HITS 1]

Each time a unit makes a Dark Pact, after it has 
resolved its attacks, it must take a Leadership test; if 
that test is failed, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

THE LOST AND THE DAMNED
Some traitors have given themselves entirely 
to the service of the Dark Gods, and they 
are so lost to damnation that they barely 
resemble the warriors they once were.

If your Army Faction is Heretic Astartes, 
you can include any of the following 
units in your army, and when you do so 
their Faction keywords are replaced with 
Heretic Astartes:

 ■ Khorne Berzerkers (see World Eaters)
 ■ Rubric Marines (see Thousand Sons)
 ■ Plague Marines (see Death Guard)

The combined points value of such units you 
can include in your army depends on the 
battle size, as follows:

 ■ Incursion: Up to 250 pts
 ■ Strike Force: Up to 500 pts
 ■ Onslaught: Up to 750 pts

CHAOS SPACE MARINES – SLAVES TO DARKNESS
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Heretic Astartes, you can use this Slaves to Darkness 
Detachment rule.

MARKS OF CHAOS
When mustering your army, each time you select a Heretic Astartes unit 
to include in your army, if that unit is not an Epic Hero and does not already 
have one or more of the keywords listed below, you must select one of the 
keywords listed below for that unit to gain (note which units gain which 
keywords in this way on your Army Roster). Each time a unit with one of 
these keywords makes a Dark Pact, it gains the associated ability below until 
the end of the phase.

KEYWORD  
Khorne  
 

Tzeentch  

 

Nurgle

ABILITY
 Blood Fury: In the Fight phase, if this unit’s weapons 
gained the [LETHAL HITS] ability this phase as the 
result of a Dark Pact, each time a model in this unit 
makes an attack, an unmodified Hit roll of 5+ scores 
a Critical Hit.

 Warpfire: In the Shooting phase, if this unit’s 
weapons gained the [LETHAL HITS] ability this phase 
as the result of a Dark Pact, each time a model in this 
unit makes an attack, an unmodified Hit roll of 5+ 
scores a Critical Hit.

 Spreading Sickness: In the Shooting phase, if this 
unit’s weapons gained the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability 
this phase as the result of a Dark Pact, each time a 
model in this unit makes an attack, an unmodified 
Hit roll of 5+ scores a Critical Hit.

 Excessive Cruelty: In the Fight phase, if this unit’s 
weapons gained the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability this 
phase as the result of a Dark Pact, each time a model 
in this unit makes an attack, an unmodified Hit roll of 
5+ scores a Critical Hit. 

Chaos Undivided  

 Glory to Chaos: Each time a model in this unit makes 
an attack, re-roll a Hit roll of 1.

RESTRICTIONS
 ■ You cannot select the Khorne keyword for a Psyker unit to gain.
 ■   A Character unit with the Leader ability can only be attached to a 

Bodyguard unit if both of those units share one of the same keywords from 
the list above.

CHAOS SPACE MARINES – SLAVES TO DARKNESS
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Slaves to Darkness Detachment rule, you can use these Slaves to Darkness Stratagems.

1CP

ETERNAL HATE
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Heretic Astartes are fuelled by hate, a searing 
spite that burns fiercely within them unto the 
very moment of death. Even as their life force 
pours from terrible wounds, this loathing can 
drive them to fight on in a second wind of 
wrath. Those Heretic Astartes in thrall to the 
Blood God feel this enmity to an even greater 
extent than others, exploding with violence 
just as the enemy think they have finally 
ended them.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit from 
your army that was selected as the target of 
one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if that 
model has not fought this phase, roll one 
D6, adding 1 to the result if it is a Khorne 
unit: on a 4+, do not remove it from play. That 
destroyed model can fight after the attacking 
model’s unit has finished making its attacks, 
and is then removed from play.

2CP

1CP

INFERNAL RITES
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

With gruesome offerings and ritualised 
promises, the Chaos Space Marines seek 
the protection of their infernal masters.

WHEN:  Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, worsen 
the Armour Penetration characteristic of 
that attack by 1.

PROFANE ZEAL
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Fervent mortal followers flock to the 
champions of Chaos, damning their souls 
seeking promises of dark power.

WHEN:  Your Shooting phase or the 
Fight phase.
TARGET: : One Heretic Astartes unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
shoot or fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes an 
attack, re-roll a Hit roll of 1 and re-roll a 
Wound roll of 1. If your unit is a Chaos 
Undivided unit, you can instead re-roll 
the Hit roll and you can re-roll the Wound 
roll for that attack.

DARK OBSCURATION
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – STRATEGIC PLOY 
STRATAGEM

Choking fogs echoing with the screams 
of tortured souls; dense clouds of bloated 
flies; deluges of bloody rain; whirlwinds of 
coruscating flames blazing in a thousand 
hues. Such warp-born phenomena can 
appear on the battlefield in an instant, 
and disappear just as quickly. All serve 
to obscure the Heretic Astartes from their 
terrified foes.

WHEN:  Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has selected 
its targets.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your 
unit has the Stealth ability. In addition, if 
your unit is a Nurgle unit, until the end of 
the phase, your unit can only be selected 
as the target of a ranged attack if the 
attacking model is within 12".

1CP

1CP

SKINSHIFT
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

With the Dark Gods and the powers of the 
warp on their side, Chaos Space Marines 
can cheat death altogether. Their foes 
look on in horror as killing wounds knit 
themselves together in a cacophony 
of hideous cracks and squelches and 
shattered armour reforms. After such a 
blessing, the Heretic Astartes are both 
something far greater, and far less, than 
what they once were.

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: One model in your unit regains 
up to 3 lost wounds. In addition, if your 
unit is a Tzeentch unit below its Starting 
Strength, one destroyed model (excluding 
Character models) is returned to your 
unit with its full wounds remaining.

UNNATURAL SWIFTNESS
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – STRATEGIC  
PLOY STRATAGEM

Some Heretic Astartes appear to move 
with a speed that should be impossible, 
weapons and bodies seemingly moving 
from one place to another in the blink of 
an eye.

WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit 
is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in 
a turn in which it Fell Back. In addition, if 
your unit is a Slaanesh unit, until the end 
of the turn, your unit is eligible to shoot 
and declare a charge in a turn in which 
it Advanced.

CHAOS SPACE MARINES – SLAVES TO DARKNESS
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Slaves to Darkness Detachment rule, you can use these Slaves to Darkness Enhancements.
TALISMAN OF BURNING BLOOD
This talisman constantly drips with thick, bubbling 
gore. The air around it is so heavy with the charnel 
stench of the slaughterhouse that it imbues the 
bearer’s limbs with supernatural ferocity and strength 
– a welcome boon to those eager to claim the 
worthiest skulls for Khorne.

INTOXICATING ELIXIR
This dispenser is filled with a self-replenishing liquid 
that is pumped into the bearer’s bloodstream by 
the pint. Some say the liquid, which grants those 
that partake of it unholy physical power, is a nectar 
distilled from Slaanesh’s own pleasure gardens, for 
while it heightens the bearer’s abilities, foes caught 
in its soporific fumes are paralysed with terror 
and ecstasy.

Heretic Astartes Slaanesh model only. The bearer 
has the Feel No Pain 5+ ability. Each time the bearer 
shoots or fights, if the bearer’s unit made a Dark 
Pact this phase, after the bearer has resolved those 
attacks, select one enemy unit that was hit by one or 
more of those attacks; that enemy unit must take a 
Battle-shock test. 
LIBER HERETICUS
This cursed tome contains forbidden lore said to 
have been absorbed while the artefact consumed the 
minds of those who risked reading it. One with the 
strength to tame it can use it to empower their rituals.

Heretic Astartes Chaos Undivided model only. 
Each time the bearer’s unit makes a Dark Pact, that 
unit’s weapons gain the [LETHAL HITS] and [SUSTAINED 
HITS 1] ability until the end of the phase, instead of 
just gaining one of those abilities.

Heretic Astartes Khorne model only. Add 1 to the 
Attacks and Strength characteristics of the bearer’s 
melee weapons. Each time the bearer’s unit makes 
a Dark Pact, until the end of the phase, add D3 to the 
Attacks and Strength characteristics of the bearer’s 
melee weapons instead. 
EYE OF TZEENTCH
The Eye of Tzeentch is a relic that has been exposed 
to wild psychic energies for ten millennia. Champions  
who stare into the artefact’s unblinking depths can 
glean the secrets of the warp.

Heretic Astartes Tzeentch model only. Each time 
the bearer’s unit makes a Dark Pact, take a Leadership 
test for the bearer: if that test is passed, you gain 1CP. 
ORBS OF UNLIFE
Within these glassy spheres lurks a diluted life-eater 
virus. Although quick to burn out when the sphere is 
broken, everything nearby not touched by Nurgle’s 
bountiful blessings – flesh, armour and bone – finds 
itself consumed by the ravaging viral strain..

Heretic Astartes Nurgle model only. At the end 
of the Fight phase, roll one D6 for every enemy unit 
within 6" of the bearer, adding 1 to the result if the 
bearer’s unit made a Dark Pact that phase: on a 4+, 
that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

step ahead of capture, and strife blooms in his wake as violently as 
the detonations from his masterwork pistols. He is a lord of the hunted 
Fallen, though his true role as traitor or loyalist is as cryptic as the 
sword he carries but never wields.
