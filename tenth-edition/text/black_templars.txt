BLACK TEMPLARS – RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS
DETACHMENT RULE

The Black Templars are the most zealous of all the Space Marine Chapters. To them, the Emperor is a literal deity, 
and there is no oath they will not swear, no vow they will not take or bloody act of battlefield worship they will 
not perform in his name. 

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can use 
this Righteous Crusaders Detachment rule.

RESTRICTIONS
 ■  Your army cannot include any Adeptus Astartes 

Psyker models, and cannot include any of the 
following models that do not have the Black 
Templars keyword: Gladiator Lancer; Gladiator 
Reaper; Gladiator Valiant; Impulsor; Repulsor; 
Repulsor Executioner.

 ■  Your army can include Black Templars units, but it 

cannot include any Adeptus Astartes units drawn from 
any other Chapter.

TEMPLAR VOWS
On the eve of battle, the warriors of a Black Templars 
crusade gather together to be led in prayer and 
contemplation by their Chaplains. In their righteous zeal, 
united in their hatred of the foe, they swear a mighty vow 
to uphold in the battle ahead.

At the start of the first battle round, select one of the four 
Templar Vows below to be active for Adeptus Astartes 
units from your army until the end of the battle.

 ■  Suffer Not the Unclean to Live: Melee weapons 
equipped by models in this unit have the [LETHAL 
HITS] ability.

 ■  Uphold the Honour of the Emperor: Models in this 

unit have the Feel No Pain 6+ ability and a Leadership 
characteristic of 5+.

 ■  Abhor the Witch, Destroy the Witch: Models in this unit 

have a 4+ invulnerable save against Psychic Attacks 
and melee weapons equipped by models in this unit 
have the [ANTI-PSYKER 4+] ability.

 ■  Accept Any Challenge, No Matter the Odds: Melee 
weapons equipped by models in this unit have the 
[SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

BLACK TEMPLARS – RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Righteous Crusaders Detachment rule, you can use these Righteous 
Crusaders Stratagems.

1CP

FERVENT ACCLAMATION
RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

The magnetic force of this Black Templar’s 
oratory inspires his fellow warriors to 
swear great vows, even in the midst of 
the battle.

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes 
Character unit from your army.
EFFECT: Select one Templar Vow that is 
not active for your army. Until the start 
of your next Command phase, while that 
Character is leading a unit, models in 
that unit gain the benefits of that vow in 
addition to the vow selected to be active 
for your army at the start of the battle.

NO ESCAPE
RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS – STRATEGIC PLOY 
STRATAGEM

DEVOUT PUSH
RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS – STRATEGIC PLOY 
STRATAGEM

1CP

With a zealous cry, the Black Templars 
press forward towards victory.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has shot.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that had one or more of 
its models destroyed as a result of the 
attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal 
move of up to D6", but it must end that 
move closer to the enemy unit that just 
shot. If the Abhor the Witch, Destroy the 
Witch vow is active for your army, your 
unit can make a Normal move of up to 6" 
instead, but it must end that move either 
closer to the enemy unit that just shot, or 
closer to the closest enemy Psyker unit. 

1CP

Glowing blades and revving chainswords 
close off the foe’s every avenue of escape.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Movement phase, 
when an enemy unit (excluding Vehicles 
and Monsters) is selected to Fall Back.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army that is within Engagement 
Range of that enemy unit.
EFFECT: Roll one D6, adding 1 to the result 
if the Accept Any Challenge, No Matter 
the Odds vow is active for your army. On 
a 4+, that enemy unit cannot Fall Back 
this phase and must Remain Stationary. 
Otherwise, that enemy unit can Fall Back 
this phase, but if it does, all models in that 
unit must take a Desperate Escape test. 

BLACK TEMPLARS – RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Righteous Crusaders Detachment rule, you can use these Righteous 
Crusaders Stratagems.

1CP

ARMOUR OF CONTEMPT
RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS – BATTLE TACTIC 
STRATAGEM

The belligerency and transhuman 
physiologies of the Adeptus Astartes make 
them unyielding foes.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, worsen 
the Armour Penetration characteristic of 
that attack by 1.

CRUSADER’S WRATH
RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS – BATTLE TACTIC 
STRATAGEM

1CP

VICIOUS RIPOSTE
RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Every blow struck against a Black Templar 
is answered in kind. Even as they are 
laid low, their blades still lash out at the 
enemies of the divine Emperor.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit is destroyed, 
if that model has not fought this phase, 
roll one D6, adding 1 to the result if the 
Uphold the Honour of the Emperor vow 
is active for your army. On a 4+, do not 
remove the destroyed model from play; it 
can fight after the attacking model’s unit 
has finished making its attacks, and is 
then removed from play.

1CP

The Black Templars channel their fervour 
into a hate-fuelled flurry of blows.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes a melee 
attack, improve the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of that attack by 1. If the 
Suffer Not The Unclean to Live vow is 
active for your army, add 1 to the Strength 
characteristic of that attack as well. 

 

BLACK TEMPLARS – RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Righteous Crusaders Detachment rule, you can use these Righteous 
Crusaders Enhancements.
PERDITION’S EDGE
With blades carved from noctilith, these axes 
separate the victim’s soul from the warp briefly as 
the death blow is delivered. What is only a moment 
in reality feels like an eternity of damnation to the 
departing spirit – punishment for their sins against 
the immortal Emperor.

SIGISMUND’S SEAL
This sheet of paper-thin adamantine is inscribed with 
an oath of moment taken by Sigismund under the 
gaze of the Emperor himself. Such a relic is gifted only 
to a warrior displaying exemplary martial prowess, 
galvanising the battle-brothers around them to reach 
new heights of righteous ferocity.

Adeptus Astartes model only. 

Adeptus Astartes model only. 

 ■  Improve the Strength and Armour Penetration 

characteristics of the bearer’s melee weapons by 1.
 ■  If the Suffer Not the Unclean to Live vow is active for 
your army, add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of the 
bearer’s melee weapons as well. 
WITCHSEEKER BOLTS
With casings forged from the blades of fallen 
battle-brothers and blessed by the devout priests of 
the Ministorum, these bolt rounds have an unerring 
habit of finding their way to the heart of the witch.

Adeptus Astartes model only. 

 ■  The bearer’s ranged weapons have the [PRECISION], 
[ANTI-PSYKER 4+] and [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] abilities.

 ■  If the Abhor the Witch, Destroy the Witch vow is 

active for your army, each time the bearer makes 
a ranged attack that targets a Psyker unit, you can 
re-roll the Hit roll and you can re-roll the Wound roll.

 ■  Improve the Attacks characteristic of the bearer’s 

melee weapons by 1. 

 ■  While the bearer is leading a unit, if the Accept Any 
Challenge, No Matter the Odds vow is active for your 
army, each time a model in that unit makes a melee 
attack, a successful unmodified Hit roll of 5+ scores 
a Critical Hit.
TÄNNHAUSER’S BONES
Marshal Tännhauser was martyred at the hands 
of the Black Legion at the decisive battle of the 
Rutger’s Reach Crusade. His bones, encased in small 
reliquaries, were distributed amongst the warriors 
of that crusade during the victory sermon. Each is a 
potent reminder of duty and the expectations placed 
upon every Black Templar.

Adeptus Astartes model only.

 ■  Each time an attack is allocated to the bearer, halve 

the Damage characteristic of that attack.

 ■  While the bearer is leading a unit, if the Uphold the 
Honour of the Emperor vow is active for your army, 
models in that unit have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability.
