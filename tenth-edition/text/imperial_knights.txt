IMPERIAL KNIGHTS
ARMY RULES

Imperial Knights fight by a stringent set of codes to ensure that in addition to defeating the enemy, honour is 
always upheld.

CODE CHIVALRIC
If your Army Faction is Imperial Knights, at the 
end of the Read Mission Objectives step, you must 
select one of the Oaths below to be active for your 
army. Models from your army with this ability gain the 
associated Oath ability, and you gain the associated 
Deed to complete.

If, at the start of any of your Command phases, 
your selected Oath’s Deed is completed, your army 
becomes Honoured for the rest of the battle and 
you gain 3CP (you can only gain CP in this way once 
per battle).

LAY LOW THE TYRANT
 ■  Oath Ability: Each time this model is selected to 

shoot or fight, re-roll a Hit roll of 1 and re-roll a 
Wound roll of 1. 

 ■  Deed: This deed is completed if the enemy 

Warlord is destroyed. 

RECLAIM THE REALM
 ■  Oath Ability: Add 1" to this model’s Move 

characteristic and add 1 to Advance and Charge rolls 
made for this model.

 ■  Deed: This deed is completed if you control one 

or more objective markers in your opponent’s 
deployment zone.

BONDSMAN ABILITIES 
Some Questoris models have a Bondsman ability, 
tagged with the word ‘Bondsman’. In your Command 
phase, one or more models from your army with a 
Bondsman ability can use that ability. For each one 
that does, select one friendly Armiger model within 
12" of that model (you cannot select an Armiger 
model that is already being affected by a Bondsman 
ability). Until the start of your next Command phase, 
both of those models (i.e. the model that just used its 
Bondsman ability and the Armiger model you just 
selected) are affected by that Bondsman ability.

SUPER-HEAVY WALKER 
Each time a model with this ability makes a Normal, 
Advance or Fall Back move, it can move over models 
(excluding Titanic models) and terrain features that 
are 4" or less in height as if they were not there. 

FREEBLADES 
Freeblades often wander the galaxy, aiding the 
armies of the Imperium against the xenos and 
heretics who threaten the Emperor’s realm.

If every model in your army has the Imperium 
keyword, you can include either 1 Titanic 
Imperial Knights model or up to 3 Armiger 
models in your army, even if they do not have 
the Faction keyword you selected in the Select 
Army Faction step. None of these models 
can be your Warlord, and they cannot be 
given Enhancements.

IMPERIAL KNIGHTS – NOBLE LANCE
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Imperial Knights, you can 
use this Noble Lance Detachment rule.

INDOMITABLE HEROES 
Gathered into a powerful formation known as a lance, 
Imperial Knights and the Nobles who pilot them wage 
their honour-driven assaults with renowned resilience 
and bloody-minded determination.

All Imperial Knights models from your army have 
the Feel No Pain 6+ ability. If your army is Honoured, 
those models have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability.

IMPERIAL KNIGHTS – NOBLE LANCE
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Noble Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Noble Lance Enhancements.
REVERED KNIGHT (AURA)
Never hesitating before tyrannical invaders, this 
Knight is beheld as the very epitome of honour – a 
monolithic incarnation of the Imperium. While they 
stand, courage is inviolate and victory is assured.

MYTHIC HERO
This warrior is a legendary figure who embodies the 
Code Chivalric, and tales of their deeds have spread 
far and wide. To be a Bondsman to such a warrior is a 
great honour indeed.

Imperial Knights model only. While a friendly 
Imperial Knights model is within 6" of the bearer, 
improve that model’s Leadership characteristic by 1. 
If your army is Honoured, increase the range of this 
Aura ability to 12".
MYSTERIOUS GUARDIAN
Manifesting as though from nowhere, this Noble’s 
titanic steed is an elemental force of vengeance 
against the Emperor of Mankind’s foes. At battle’s end, 
it disappears as mysteriously as it arrived.

Imperial Knights model only. The bearer has the 
Deep Strike ability. Once per battle, at the end of 
your opponent’s turn, if the bearer is not within 
Engagement Range of any enemy units, it can fade 
away. If it does, remove it from the battlefield then, 
in the Reinforcements step of your subsequent 
Movement phase, set it up anywhere on the 
battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from 
all enemy models. If the battle ends and the bearer is 
not on the battlefield, it is destroyed.

Questoris model with a Bondsman ability only. Each 
time the bearer uses its Bondsman ability, you can 
select one additional friendly Armiger model within 
12" of the bearer that is not already being affected 
by a Bondsman ability. Until the start of your next 
Command phase, that model is also affected by that 
Bondsman ability.
BANNER OF MACHARIUS 
TRIUMPHANT
A gift from Lord Solar Macharius himself to honour the 
noble houses that accompanied his crusade, legend 
has it that this banner has never seen defeat: every 
time a Knight has carried it to war, a great victory has 
been won.

Imperial Knights model only. If you control an 
objective marker at the end of your Command phase 
and the bearer is within range of that objective 
marker, that objective marker remains under your 
control even if you have no models within range of it, 
until your opponent controls it at the start or end of 
any turn. 
UNYIELDING PARAGON
This Knight is an unyielding army unto themselves, 
capable of engaging entire enemy forces and holding 
their ground, emerging through the fiercest firestorms 
bloodied, but unbowed.

Questoris model only. Each time an attack is 
allocated to the bearer, worsen the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of that attack by 1.

IMPERIAL KNIGHTS – NOBLE LANCE
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Noble Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Noble Lance Stratagems.
THUNDERSTOMP
NOBLE LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

SHOULDER THE BURDEN
NOBLE LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

2CP

When faced with their darkest hour, knightly 
Nobles rise to the challenge, for nothing 
shall deter them from fulfilling their duty.

1CP

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model 
from your army that has lost one or 
more wounds.
EFFECT: Until the start of your next 
Command phase, improve your model’s 
Move, Toughness, Save, Leadership and 
Objective Control characteristics by 1 and 
each time your model makes an attack, 
add 1 to the Hit roll.
RESTRICTIONS: You can only use this 
Stratagem once per battle. If your army 
is Honoured, you can use this Stratagem 
one additional time.

ROTATE ION SHIELDS
NOBLE LANCE – WARGEAR STRATAGEM

Veteran Knight pilots can swiftly angle their 
ion shields to better deflect incoming fire.

1CP

1CP

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has selected 
its targets.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
that Imperial Knights model has a 4+ 
invulnerable save against ranged attacks.

The Noble brings their Knight suit’s full 
weight crashing down with the force of 
an industrial piledriver. Few can survive 
such a blow.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model 
from your army that has not been 
selected to fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
your model cannot target Monster or 
Vehicle units, but all melee weapons 
equipped by your model have the 
[DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability.

SQUIRES’ DUTY
NOBLE LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Under the scrutiny and judgement of their 
Noble betters, Armiger pilots will redouble 
their efforts, attacking as one to smash 
aside their foes.

WHEN: The start of your Shooting phase or 
the start of the Fight phase.
TARGET: Two or more Armiger models 
from your army and one enemy unit 
that is an eligible target for all of those 
Armiger models.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
improve the Strength and Armour 
Penetration characteristics of weapons 
equipped by those Armiger models by 
1. If your army is Honoured, until the 
end of the phase, add 1 to the Damage 
characteristic of those weapons as well.

IMPERIAL KNIGHTS – NOBLE LANCE
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Noble Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Noble Lance Stratagems.

1CP

TROPHY CLAIM
NOBLE LANCE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Once a mighty foe is laid low, the 
victorious Knight’s emitters blare its 
triumph, announcing the glory brought 
to the Imperium, but shame awaits those 
who fail in such confrontations.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the 
Fight phase.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model 
from your army that has not been 
selected to shoot or fight this phase, and 
one enemy Monster or Vehicle unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time your model makes an attack that 
targets that enemy unit, add 1 to the 
Wound roll. If your model destroys that 
enemy unit this phase, you gain 1CP, but if 
your model does not destroy that enemy 
unit this phase, you cannot use this 
Stratagem again for the rest of the battle. 

1CP

VALIANT LAST STAND
NOBLE LANCE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Badly wounded, their Knight’s generator 
on the verge of overload, still the Noble 
fights on, drawing upon their reserves of 
chivalric heroism to sell their life as dearly 
as they can.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model 
from your army that was just destroyed 
and that is eligible to fight but has not 
been selected to fight this phase. You can 
use this Stratagem on that model even 
though it was just destroyed.
EFFECT: Before rolling to see if this model 
deals any mortal wounds as a result of its 
Deadly Demise ability, it can fight; when 
doing so, it is assumed to have 1 wound 
remaining, or all its wounds remaining 
if your army is Honoured. After it has 
finished resolving its attacks, resolve its 
Deadly Demise ability as normal.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot target 
Sir Hekhtur with this Stratagem.

USING SIR HEKHTUR

When your Canis Rex model is destroyed, Sir Hekhtur is 
treated as a model disembarking from a destroyed Transport 
– set him up within 3" of your Canis Rex model before it is 
removed. Sir Hekhtur then uses the profile, wargear, abilities 
and keywords shown on this side of the card, but cannot be 
selected as the target of any of your Stratagems other than 
Core Stratagems. Your Canis Rex unit is not considered to be 
destroyed until Sir Hekhtur is also destroyed.
