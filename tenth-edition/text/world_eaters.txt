WORLD EATERS
ARMY RULE

Khorne is the god of warfare and slaughter, and provides mighty boons to those who consecrate the battlefield 
in his name.

BLESSINGS OF KHORNE
If your Army Faction is World Eaters, at the start of 
the battle round, you can make a Blessings of Khorne 
roll. To do so, roll eight D6. You can then use those dice 
to activate up to two Blessings of Khorne from the 
Blessings of Khorne list (see right). Each Blessing of 
Khorne specifies the dice results it requires (where 
a number is specified, a double or triple of that 
value or higher is required). You can only activate 
each Blessing of Khorne once per battle round. Any 
unused dice from the Blessings of Khorne roll are 
then discarded.

Once activated, each Blessing of Khorne applies to all 
units from your army with this ability until the end of 
the battle round.

Example: Ash makes their Blessings of Khorne roll 
and gets the following dice: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6.

First they use the two 6s to activate Warp Blades 
(which requires a double 5+), leaving the following 
dice: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4.

They then use the two 2s to activate Wrathful 
Devotion (which requires any double), leaving the 
following dice: 1, 2, 3, 4.

However, now that they have activated two Blessings 
of Khorne, they cannot activate any more and the 
remaining dice are discarded.

RAGE-FUELLED INVIGORATION 
ANY DOUBLE
Add 2" to the Move characteristic of models in 
this unit.

WRATHFUL DEVOTION 
ANY DOUBLE
Models in this unit have the Feel No Pain 6+ ability. 
If models in this unit already have the Feel No Pain 
ability, add 1 to their Feel No Pain rolls.

MARTIAL EXCELLENCE 
DOUBLE 3+
Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have 
the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

TOTAL CARNAGE
DOUBLE 4+ OR ANY TRIPLE
Each time a model in this unit is destroyed by a 
melee attack, if that model has not fought this phase, 
roll one D6: on a 4+, do not remove it from play. The 
destroyed model can fight after the attacking model’s 
unit has finished making its attacks, and is then 
removed from play.

WARP BLADES
DOUBLE 5+ OR ANY TRIPLE
Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have 
the [LETHAL HITS] ability.

UNBRIDLED BLOODLUST 
DOUBLE 6 OR TRIPLE 4+
This unit is eligible to declare a charge in a turn in 
which it Advanced.

WORLD EATERS – BERZERKER WARBAND
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is World Eaters, you can use 
this Berzerker Warband Detachment rule.

RELENTLESS RAGE
The World Eaters fight in a perpetual fury, 
driven ever onwards to slaughter all who 
stand in their way. All of their warriors have 
been subject to horrific psycho-surgery, 
implanted with crude devices that amplify 
their aggression, while some also submit to 
possession by the raging daemons of the 
Blood God. Whatever drives their berserk 
rage, these warriors only stop killing when 
every foe lies in ruin at their feet – and 
sometimes not even then.

Each time a World Eaters unit from 
your army is selected to fight, if 
that unit made a Charge move 
this turn, until the end of the 
phase, add 1 to the Strength and 
Attacks characteristics of melee 
weapons equipped by models 
in that unit.

WORLD EATERS – BERZERKER WARBAND
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Berzerker Warband Detachment rule, you can use these Berzerker 
Warband Stratagems.

GORY MASSACRE

BERZERKER WARBAND – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Those who witness the massacres 
inflicted by the World Eaters flee to avoid 
being the next victims.

1CP

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One World Eaters unit from 
your army that made a Charge move this 
turn and destroyed one or more enemy 
units this phase.
EFFECT: In your opponent’s next 
Command phase, each enemy unit within 
6" of your unit must take a Battle-shock 
test. If the unit taking that test is Below 
Half-strength, subtract 1 from that test. 
Enemy units affected by this Stratagem 
do not need to take any other Battle-shock 
tests in the same phase.

FOR THE SKULL THRONE!

BERZERKER WARBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

2CP

1CP

Khorne rewards those who test their might 
against the strongest foes, blessing the 
greatest warriors with his favour.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One World Eaters unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
each time a model in your unit makes a 
melee attack that targets a Character, 
Monster or Vehicle unit, add 1 to the 
Wound roll. 

FOR THE BLOOD GOD!
BERZERKER WARBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

When blood spills, the blessings of the 
Blood God are bountiful.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after a World 
Eaters unit from your army destroys an 
enemy unit.
TARGET: That World Eaters unit.
EFFECT: Make a Blessings of Khorne 
roll. You can use the results of this roll 
to activate one Blessing of Khorne. 
That Blessing of Khorne does not count 
towards your maximum number of 
activated Blessings of Khorne, but all 
other rules for Blessings of Khorne apply.

KHORNE CARES NOT…

BERZERKER WARBAND – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Khorne cares not from whence the blood 
flows, so long as it flows, and mere flesh 
wounds will not stay the wrath of the 
World Eaters.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One World Eaters unit from 
your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of that enemy 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, subtract 
1 from the Damage characteristic of 
that attack. 

WORLD EATERS – BERZERKER WARBAND
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Berzerker Warband Detachment rule, you can use these Berzerker 
Warband Stratagems.

BLOOD OFFERING

APOPLECTIC FRENZY

BERZERKER WARBAND – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

BERZERKER WARBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

The blood of Khorne’s devoted warriors 
is still blood, and when the battleground 
runs red, it is still a worthy addition to the 
Blood God’s domain.

WHEN: Any phase.
TARGET: One World Eaters unit from 
your army that was just destroyed 
while it was within range of an objective 
marker you controlled. You can use this 
Stratagem on that unit even though it was 
just destroyed.
EFFECT: That objective marker remains 
under your control, even if you have 
no models within range of it, until your 
opponent controls it at the start or end of 
any turn. 

1CP

Those who fight for Khorne are driven 
to even greater depths of rage, surging 
towards the foe in a barely controlled tide. 

WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One World Eaters unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
move this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, if your 
unit Advances, do not make an Advance 
roll for it. Instead, until the end of the 
phase, add 6" to the Move characteristic 
of models in your unit.

WORLD EATERS – BERZERKER WARBAND
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Berzerker Warband Detachment rule, you can use these Berzerker Warband Enhancements.
FAVOURED OF KHORNE
This warrior has the favour of Khorne; the Blood God 
seems to aid him in his slaughter with a portion of his 
own power.

BATTLE-LUST
This veteran killer’s lust for battle draws him into any 
and all fights, his thirst driving him to new heights of 
battlefield frenzy.

World Eaters model only. You can select the 
bearer’s unit for the Heroic Intervention Stratagem for 
0CP, and can do so even if you have already targeted a 
different unit with that Stratagem this phase.
HELM OF BRAZEN IRE
This helm is forged from unbreakable brass from the 
Blood God’s own throne. Any who seek to take the 
bearer’s skull find that their blades break upon it.

World Eaters model only. Each time an attack 
is allocated to the bearer, halve the Damage 
characteristic of that attack.

World Eaters model only. Each time you make a 
Blessings of Khorne roll, before doing anything else, 
the bearer can use this Enhancement. If it does, 
discard all of the dice from that roll and make a new 
Blessings of Khorne roll. This new roll does not count 
as a re-roll, so any rules that enable you to re-roll or 
manipulate individual dice (e.g. Icon of Khorne) can 
still be used.
BERZERKER GLAIVE
The bearer of this daemon-infested weapon is driven 
to a state of apoplectic frenzy by the proximity of its 
red-hot steel.

World Eaters model only. Add 1 to the Attacks 
and Damage characteristics of melee weapons 
equipped by the bearer. Each time the bearer ends 
a Charge move, roll one D3; until the end of the turn, 
add the result of that roll to the Attacks and Damage 
characteristics of those melee weapons instead.
