ASTRA MILITARUM
ARMY RULE

VOICE OF COMMAND
Raised and trained to instil unwavering obedience, officers 
of the Imperial Guard command authority and respect, and 
issue orders with imperious bellows that cut through the 
clamour of war.

If your Army Faction is Astra Militarum, in your 
Command phase, Officer models from your army with 
this ability can issue Orders. Each Officer’s datasheet 
will specify how many Orders it can issue and which units 
are eligible to receive those Orders. Each time an Officer 
model issues an Order, select one of the Orders below, 
then select one eligible friendly unit within 6" of that 
Officer model to issue it to. 

Until the start of your next Command phase, the unit 
you selected is affected by that Order. Unless otherwise 
stated, a unit can only be affected by one Order at a time 
(any Order subsequently issued to that unit replaces the 
current one). If a unit being affected by an Order becomes 
Battle-shocked, that Order ceases to affect that unit.

MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!
Add 3" to the Move characteristic of models in this unit.

FIX BAYONETS!
Improve the Weapon Skill characteristic of melee weapons 
equipped by models in this unit by 1.

TAKE AIM!
Improve the Ballistic Skill characteristic of ranged 
weapons equipped by models in this unit by 1.

FIRST RANK, FIRE! SECOND RANK, FIRE!
Improve the Attacks characteristic of Rapid Fire 
weapons equipped by models in this unit by 1.

TAKE COVER!
Improve the Save characteristic of models in this 
unit by 1 (this cannot improve a model’s Save to 
better than 3+).

DUTY AND HONOUR!
Improve the Leadership and Objective 
Control characteristics of models in this 
unit by 1.

ASTRA MILITARUM – COMBINED REGIMENT
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Astra Militarum, you can use 
this Combined Regiment Detachment rule.

BORN SOLDIERS
Regiments of numerous origins and tactical roles 
inculcate their soldiers from an early age with the 
legendary doctrines of the Tactica Imperium. Infantry 
and tank crews are drilled in close-range fire patterns 
in the expectation of being thrust into the front lines.

Each time an Astra Militarum unit from your army 
Remains Stationary, until the end of the turn, ranged 
weapons equipped by models in that unit have the 
[LETHAL HITS] ability.

ASTRA MILITARUM – COMBINED REGIMENT
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Combined Regiment Detachment rule, you can use these Combined 
Regiment Enhancements.
DEATH MASK OF OLLANIUS
Ollanius the Pious is the epitome of Imperial 
sainthood, believed martyred at the hands of Horus 
himself. His death mask is a terrifying piece of 
craftsmanship, depicting in obsidian and void-fired 
bronze the agonised visage of a tortured angel. 
In the millennia since his passing, Ollanius’ death 
mask has been revered as a holy relic; loyal soldiers 
in the ancient artefact’s presence are granted the 
determination of the famous martyr himself.

KUROV’S AQUILA
General Kurov was one of the most gifted officers 
in Imperial history. Upon retirement, he recorded 
dozens of tactical treatises that were translated into 
vox-ghosts and uploaded into a two-headed avian 
servitor referred to as Kurov’s Aquila. An officer who 
possesses this prestigious tool can turn to it for 
guidance. In response, the servitor’s blindfolded 
head will vocalise the most relevant vox-ghost in 
Kurov’s commanding tones, lecturing its owner on 
counter-tactics. The other head’s eyes glow above its 
bound-shut beak as they project a hololithic display 
of Kurov himself, his image flickering as it reveals the 
manoeuvres of wars long past.

Officer model only. While the bearer’s unit is 
Battle-shocked, subtract 1 from the Objective Control 
characteristic of models in that unit, instead of 
changing it to 0. 
DRILL COMMANDER
Expertly guiding their elite soldiers’ fire, this officer’s 
stentorian orders reinforce years of indoctrinated 
drills concerning the relentless application of 
accurate long-range volleys.

Officer model only. While the bearer is leading a 
unit, each time a model in that unit makes a ranged 
attack, if that unit Remained Stationary this turn, a 
Critical Hit is scored on a successful unmodified Hit 
roll of 5+.

Officer model only. Once per battle, just after your 
opponent has used a Stratagem, the bearer can use 
this Enhancement. If it does, until the end of the 
battle, the CP cost your opponent must pay to use that 
Stratagem again is increased by 1CP.
GRAND STRATEGIST 
Having commanded troops on countless battlefields, 
this veteran officer has borne witness to the manifold 
caprices of war. They have perfected just as many 
strategic responses, and bark out a constant stream 
of rapidly evolving orders as the situation demands.

Officer model only. In your Command phase, the 
bearer can issue one additional Order.

.

selected to shoot this phase, and one 
enemy unit (excluding Monsters

The sanctioned use of a Deathstrike – designated ‘Ordnance Extremis’

heinous enemies. Its huge missile, capable of mounting various 
catastrophic payloads, is able to visit the undimmed wrath of the 
Emperor on a foe half a world away.

STORMLORD
Boasting an expanded transport capacity, the Stormlord is the 
ultimate assault vehicle. From firing steps, the squads it carries level 
their own firepower at the enemy, but their shots are eclipsed by the 
hurricane of huge, mass-reactive shells unloaded by the twin barrels 
of the Stormlord’s vulcan mega-bolter.

Concussive Wave: In your Shooting phase, just after selecting 
a target for this model’s Stormsword siege cannon, roll one D6 
for the target unit and every other unit within 3" of that unit: on 
a 5+, the unit being rolled for is struck by a concussive wave. 
After this model has finished making its attacks against that 
target unit this phase, each unit struck by a concussive wave 
suffers D3 mortal wounds.

DAMAGED: 1-8 WOUNDS REMAINING

While this model has 1-8 wounds remaining, subtract 4 from

STORMSWORD
A Stormsword is ideal for clearing enemy-held choke points. The shells 
fired by its siege cannon release a concentrated concussive wave on 
detonation. Those not pulverised outright are torn apart by slivers 
of the cover they cowered behind, barricades becoming lacerating 
shards and battlements storms of razor-edged fragments.
