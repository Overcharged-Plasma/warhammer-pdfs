ADEPTUS MECHANICUS 
ARMY RULE

An Adeptus Mechanicus army marching to war is a sight 
both terrifying and glorious, each holy warrior a disturbing 
fusion of Human and machine. While the ruling Tech-
Priests and their fanatical followers raise modified voices 
in praise of the Machine God, their Skitarii soldiery and 
Servitor creations are controlled by doctrina imperatives 
loaded by their masters to augment and adapt the 
warriors’ abilities.

DOCTRINA IMPERATIVES
At the start of the battle round, you can select one of the 
Doctrina Imperatives below. Until the end of the battle 
round, that Doctrina Imperative is active for your army, and 
all units from your army that have the Doctrina Imperatives 
ability gain the relevant abilities shown below.

PROTECTOR IMPERATIVE
 ■  Ranged weapons equipped by models in this unit have 

the [HEAVY] ability.

 ■   Each time a ranged attack targets this unit, if this unit 
is within your deployment zone, worsen the Armour 
Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.

CONQUEROR IMPERATIVE
 ■  Ranged weapons equipped by models in this unit have 

the [ASSAULT] ability.

 ■   Each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack, 

if the target of that attack is within your opponent's 
deployment zone, improve the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of that attack by 1.

ADEPTUS MECHANICUS – RAD-COHORT
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Mechanicus, you can use 
this Rad-Cohort Detachment rule.

RAD-BOMBARDMENT
Whether as a result of natural phenomena, apocalyptic 
internecine strife or calamitous accidents, many forge 
worlds are heavily irradiated. When holy wars of requisition 
are unleashed, the Tech-Priests think nothing of turning 
this invisible curse upon their foes, bombarding the 
battlefield with deadly radiation prior to an assault.

BATTLE ROUND  1  

BOMBARDMENT
At the start of the first battle round, for each enemy unit 
within your opponent's deployment zone, your opponent 
must decide whether that unit will take cover or stand firm. 
If a unit takes cover, until the end of the battle round, that 
unit is Battle-shocked. If a unit stands firm, roll one D6 for 
that unit: on a 3+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

BATTLE ROUND  2 ONWARDS

FALLOUT
At the start of the second, third, fourth and fifth battle 
rounds, roll one D6 for each enemy unit within your 
opponent's deployment zone. On a 3+, that unit suffers 1 
mortal wound.

ADEPTUS MECHANICUS – RAD-COHORT
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Rad-Cohort Detachment rule, you can use these Rad-Cohort Stratagems. 
LETHAL DOSAGE
RAD-COHORT – WARGEAR STRATAGEM

BALEFUL HALO
RAD-COHORT – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

1CP

A haze of deadly radiation hangs around 
the warriors of a Rad-Cohort, every 
exhalation they make adding to the 
isotopic fog, sapping the strength and 
stamina of those who are not inured to 
its effects.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Mechanicus unit 
from your army (excluding Vehicle units) 
that was selected as the target of one or 
more of that enemy unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, each 
time an attack is made that targets your 
unit, subtract 1 from the Wound roll. 

EXTINCTION ORDER

RAD-COHORT – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

As Tech-Priests order the purge of an area 
of the battlefield, rad-bombardments are 
redoubled in the hopes of turning it into 
a wasteland.

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Tech-Priest model from 
your army and one objective marker 
within 24" of that model.
EFFECT: Roll one D6 for each enemy unit 
within range of that objective marker. On a 
4+, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound and it 
must take a Battle-shock test. 

2CP

1CP

Sanctified with the Tri-fold Litany, the 
most blessed power cells, fuel canisters 
and solid slugs have spent a decade 
in the oldest and most irradiated forge 
temple to certify their lethality.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Mechanicus 
unit from your army that has not been 
selected to shoot this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
each time a model in your unit makes a 
ranged attack that targets an enemy unit 
(excluding Vehicle units), add 1 to the 
Wound roll.

AGGRESSOR IMPERATIVE

RAD-COHORT – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The Skitarii feel the press of an invisible 
hand upon their minds as the Machine 
God drives them forward. Servos are 
pushed to their structural limits as fibre 
bundles fill with the boundless energy of 
the Motive Force and propel the faithful on 
an unstoppable crusade.

WHEN: Your Charge phase.
TARGET: One Skitarii unit from your army 
that Advanced this turn.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit 
is eligible to declare a charge even though 
it Advanced this turn.
RESTRICTIONS: You can only use this 
Stratagem if the Conqueror Imperative is 
active for your army.

ADEPTUS MECHANICUS – RAD-COHORT
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Rad-Cohort Detachment rule, you can use these Rad-Cohort Stratagems. 

1CP

VENGEFUL FALLOUT
RAD-COHORT – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The sentence for those who dare strike 
at the Tech-Priests' holy creations has 
been carefully prepared in advance and 
it can be unleashed with an anger born of 
fanatical faith.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has resolved 
its attacks.
TARGET: One Adeptus Mechanicus unit 
from your army that was selected as 
the target of one or more of that enemy 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit can shoot as if it were 
your Shooting phase, but it must target 
only that enemy unit when doing so, and 
it can only do so if that enemy unit is an 
eligible target. After your unit has finished 
making these attacks, it is not eligible to 
shoot again this turn.

1CP

BULWARK IMPERATIVE
RAD-COHORT – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The warrior wisdom of experienced 
Reductors is force-loaded into the Skitarii’s 
minds. Each pulse of data bestows a 
sensation of sacred invulnerability upon 
the Tech-Priests’ soldiers.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has selected 
its targets.
TARGET: One Skitarii unit from your army 
that was selected as the target of one or 
more of that enemy unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, models 
in your unit have a 4+ invulnerable save. 
RESTRICTIONS: You can only use this 
Stratagem if the Protector Imperative is 
active for your army.

ADEPTUS MECHANICUS – RAD-COHORT
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Rad-Cohort Detachment rule, you can use these Rad-Cohort Enhancements.
ARCHIVED PURGE PROTOCOLS
Having witnessed the rad-bombardment of a hundred 
battlefields, this experienced commander can call 
upon the minutiae of those servo-recorded conflicts, 
feeding adjusted protocols into the data-nets of their 
warriors, granting them a hyper-predictive combat 
awareness to perfectly defeat the foe as they stumble 
out from their irradiated positions.

MASTER ANNIHILATOR
With a mind blissfully unsullied by the passions 
common to the flesh, this zealot has become 
a peerless annihilator, commanding ruthless 
technology to eliminate all life before them. So 
blessed, they impart the detached logic of their 
priorities unto their minions.

Skitarii Marshal model only. At the start of the 
battle round, you can select one friendly Skitarii 
unit within 12" of the bearer. Until the start of the next 
battle round, if the Protector Imperative is active for 
your army, the Conqueror Imperative is active for that 
unit instead, and if the Conqueror Imperative is active 
for your army, the Protector Imperative is active for 
that unit instead. 
EXCORIATING EMANATION
This devoted follower of the Machine God is wreathed 
in a dense, radioactive fog that shrouds their allies 
from the sights and scanners of the foe.

Adeptus Mechanicus model only. While the bearer 
is leading a unit, models in that unit have the 
Stealth ability. 

Adeptus Mechanicus model only. While the bearer is 
leading a unit, ranged weapons equipped by models 
in that unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.  
OMNI-STERILISER
This weapon exemplifies the Adeptus Mechanicus' 
disdain for organic life. All flesh, blood and bone 
caught in its searing beams are reduced to inert 
atoms in an instant.

Adeptus Mechanicus model only. Add 3 to the 
Attacks characteristic of the bearer's ranged weapons. 
In addition, the bearer's ranged weapons have the 
[ANTI-INFANTRY 2+] and [ANTI-MONSTER 4+] abilities.
