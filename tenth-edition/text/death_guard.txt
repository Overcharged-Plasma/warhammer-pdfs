DEATH GUARD
ARMY RULE

The Death Guard are carriers of countless infections 
and contagions, each a gift from Nurgle. Whenever 
they march to war, they contaminate all around them, 
overwhelming their victims’ immune systems and 
undoing metallic bonds, alien psychic materials and all 
manner of other components, rendering even armoured 
vehicles vulnerable.

NURGLE’S GIFT (AURA)
If your Army Faction is Death Guard, while an enemy 
unit is within Contagion Range of this unit, subtract 
1 from the Toughness characteristic of models in that 
enemy unit. Contagion Range changes over the course of 
the battle, as shown below.

CONTAGION RANGE

1st Battle Round: Contagion Range = 3"

3"

2nd Battle Round: Contagion Range = 6"

6"

3rd Battle Round Onwards: Contagion Range = 9"

DEATH GUARD – PLAGUE COMPANY
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Death Guard, you can use this 
Plague Company Detachment rule.

SPREAD THE SICKNESS
To the Death Guard, spreading Nurgle’s gifts goes 
beyond the beings they fight – even the landscapes 
they tread upon they seek to corrupt, cultivating 
Nurgle’s garden as widely as possible.

If you control an objective marker at the end of your 
Command phase and a Death Guard unit from your 
army is within range of that objective marker, that 
objective marker is said to be Infected and remains 
under your control even if you have no models within 
range of it, until your opponent controls it at the start 
or end of any turn. In addition, while an objective 
marker is Infected and under your control, it has the 
Nurgle’s Gift ability as if it were a unit from your army 
(so enemy units within Contagion Range of it will have 
their Toughness characteristic modified).

DEATH GUARD – PLAGUE COMPANY
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Plague Company Detachment rule, you can use these Plague Company Stratagems.
DISGUSTINGLY RESILIENT
PLAGUE COMPANY – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

FERRIC BLIGHT
PLAGUE COMPANY – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP2CP

Those favoured by Nurgle are inured to 
pain, their rotting bodies shrugging off all 
but the most traumatic damage with ease.

1CP

The spreading rust of the Ferric Blight can 
reduce armour of all kinds to nothing.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the 
Fight phase.
TARGET: One Death Guard unit from your 
army that has not been selected to shoot 
or fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes an 
attack, improve the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of that attack by 1. If the 
target of that attack is within Contagion 
Range of an Infected objective marker 
you control and a Critical Wound is scored 
for that attack, improve the Armour 
Penetration characteristic of that attack 
by 2 instead. 

SANGUOUS FLUX
PLAGUE COMPANY – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

1CP1CP1CP

Bleeding sores erupt all over enemies 
afflicted by the Sanguous Flux, the wounds 
never clotting or healing.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Death Guard unit from your 
army that has not been selected to fight 
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
weapons equipped by models in your unit 
have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability. While 
your unit is within range of an Infected 
objective marker you control, those 
weapons have the [SUSTAINED HITS 2] 
ability instead.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Death Guard unit from your 
army that was selected as the target of 
one or more of that enemy unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack is allocated to a model in 
your unit, subtract 1 from the Damage 
characteristic of that attack.

GIFTS OF DECAY
PLAGUE COMPANY – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Nurgle is a generous god, and through 
worship and devotion his followers can 
gain mighty rewards as they spread 
sickness in his name.

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Death Guard model from 
your army.
EFFECT: Your model regains up to D3 lost 
wounds. If your model’s unit is within 
Contagion Range of an Infected objective 
marker you control, your model regains 
up to 3 lost wounds instead. 

DEATH GUARD – PLAGUE COMPANY

If you are using the Plague Company Detachment rule, you can use these Plague Company Stratagems.

BOILBLIGHT
PLAGUE COMPANY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The strange lumps that form on victims 
of Boilblight – also known as Nurgle’s 
Fruit, Lumpen Splatter or the Crawling 
Pustulence – are easy to spot at a 
distance for the Death Guard.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Death Guard unit from 
your army, and one enemy unit within 
Contagion Range of that unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a weapon equipped by a Death 
Guard model from your army targets that 
enemy unit, that weapon has the [HEAVY] 
and [IGNORES COVER] abilities.

CLOUD OF FLIES
PLAGUE COMPANY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP1CP

With a thrumming roar, a thick cloud of 
daemon flies whirls around the Death Guard 
and obscures them from the enemy’s sight.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has selected 
its targets.
TARGET: One Death Guard unit from your 
army that was selected as the target of 
one or more of that enemy unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your 
unit has the Stealth ability.

DEATH GUARD – PLAGUE COMPANY
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Plague Company Detachment rule, you can use these Plague Company Enhancements.
LIVING PLAGUE
Saturated as he is with Nurgle’s contagious blessings, 
merely to stand before this warlord is to be assailed 
by an oppressive aura of plague.

DEADLY PATHOGEN
When this pathogen finds a victim – whether organic 
or machine – it rapidly replicates, causing horrific 
damage before burning out.

Death Guard model only. Add 3" to the range of the 
bearer’s Aura abilities (including Nurgle’s Gift).
THE DRONING (AURA)
This warrior is surrounded by a cloud of dreaded 
plague flies that harass the Death Guard’s enemies 
and feed on their sanity.

Death Guard model only. While an enemy unit is 
within Contagion Range of the bearer, each time that 
unit fails a Battle-shock test, roll one D6: on a 2-5, that 
unit suffers 1 mortal wound; on a 6, that unit suffers 
D3 mortal wounds.

Death Guard model only. Add 1 to the Strength 
and Attacks characteristics of the bearer’s melee 
weapons. While the bearer is within range of an 
Infected objective marker you control, add 2 to the 
Strength and Attacks characteristics of the bearer’s 
melee weapons instead.
SHAMBLEROT
The strains of the zombie virus carried by the Death 
Guard slowly but surely break mortals around 
them, sapping their strength and dexterity before 
consuming them utterly.

Death Guard model only. Each time the bearer’s unit 
is selected as a target of an enemy unit’s charge, until 
the end of the phase, subtract 2 from Charge rolls 
made for that enemy unit.

MALIGNANT PLAGUECASTER
Every foetid fibre of a Malignant Plaguecaster’s body is rotted and 
decayed. They are living conduits for the Garden of Nurgle’s miasmas 
and maladies. Foul blights reside within their roiling, bloated frames, 
and when they are unleashed in an eruption of vomit and gases they 
liquefy metal, stone and flesh.
