NECRONS
ARMY RULE

The scattered dynasties of the Necrons pursue many 
different paths to dominance, embracing their own 
traditions and martial doctrines. All dynasties also benefit 
from the nigh-supernatural technologies that once saw 
them dominate the galaxy, perhaps the most unsettling 
of which are their reanimation protocols. Should a Necron 
be slain, its body becomes wreathed in an eerie glow. 
Crawling limbs reattach, sundered torsos and smashed 
skulls reform and the Necron rises again, shambling back 
into battle.

REANIMATION PROTOCOLS
If your Army Faction is Necrons, at the end of your 
Command phase, each unit from your army with this 
ability activates its Reanimation Protocols and reanimates 
D3 wounds. Each time such a unit reanimates a wound:

 ■  If that unit contains one or more models with fewer 

than their starting number of wounds remaining, 
select one of those models; that model regains one 
lost wound. 

 ■  If all models in that unit have their starting number of 

wounds, but that unit is not at its Starting Strength, 
one destroyed model is returned to that unit with one 
wound remaining. 

Once such a unit is at its Starting Strength and all of its 
models have their starting number of wounds, nothing 
further happens.

Example: A unit of Lokhust Destroyers (which have a 
Wounds characteristic of 3) activates its Reanimation 
Protocols. The unit had a Starting Strength of 3, but 
currently contains 2 models, and one of those models 
has lost 1 wound. A 3 is rolled to see how many 
wounds are reanimated. The first of these reanimated 
wounds restores the wounded Lokhust Destroyer 
back to 3 wounds. The second of these reanimated 
wounds returns the destroyed Lokhust Destroyer to the 
battlefield with 1 wound remaining. The third of these 
reanimated wounds restores one of the remaining lost 
wounds to the same Lokhust Destroyer that was just 
returned. The unit now contains 3 models, two 
of which have 3 wounds remaining and one of 
which has 2 wounds remaining.

NECRONS – AWAKENED DYNASTY
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Necrons, you can use this 
Awakened Dynasty Detachment rule.

COMMAND PROTOCOLS
The Necron nobility make war in a codified and relentless 
fashion. Their command protocols crackle out across 
multi-dimensional spectra from carrier-wave projectors, 
compelling their semi-sentient soldiery into battle one 
overriding directive at a time.

While a Necrons Character model is leading this unit, 
each time a model in this unit makes an attack, add 1 to 
the Hit roll.

NECRONS – AWAKENED DYNASTY
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Awakened Dynasty Detachment rule, you can use these Awakened 
Dynasty Stratagems.

PROTOCOL OF THE ETERNAL GUARDIAN 

PROTOCOL OF THE HUNGRY VOID

AWAKENED DYNASTY – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

AWAKENED DYNASTY – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

Necron rulers possess sophisticated 
self-repair systems that can reknit their 
corporeal forms so they can once more 
command their legions.

WHEN: Any phase.
TARGET: One Necrons Infantry 
Character model from your army that 
was just destroyed.
EFFECT: Set your model back up on the 
battlefield as close as possible to where 
it was destroyed and more than 1" away 
from all enemy models, with half of its 
starting number of wounds remaining.  
RESTRICTIONS: Each model can only 
be targeted with this Stratagem once 
per battle.

1CP

The Necrons strike with data-augmented 
accuracy, their murderous attacks as 
inescapable as the killing cold of space.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from your 
army that has not been selected to fight 
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, add 
1 to the Strength characteristic of melee 
weapons equipped by models in your 
unit. In addition, If a Necrons Character 
is leading your unit, until the end of the 
phase, improve the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of melee weapons 
equipped by models in your unit by 1.

PROTOCOL OF THE CONQUERING TYRANT

AWAKENED DYNASTY – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

The legions employ the strategies of their 
masters in perfect synchronicity, laying 
down hails of mechanically coordinated fire.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from your 
army that has not been selected to shoot 
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes an attack 
that targets a unit within half of the firing 
weapon’s range, you can re-roll the Wound 
roll. If a Necrons Character is leading 
your unit, until the end of the phase, this 
effect applies at the firing weapon’s full 
range instead.

Dynasty Stratagems.

PROTOCOL OF THE UNDYING LEGIONS

PROTOCOL OF THE VENGEFUL STARS

AWAKENED DYNASTY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

AWAKENED DYNASTY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

In response to enemy attack, criss-cross 
fire leaps from the Necron ranks, forming 
a blazing corona of deadly energy from 
which there can be no escape. 

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has resolved 
its attacks.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from your 
army that had one or more of its models 
destroyed as a result of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit can shoot as if it were 
your Shooting phase, but it must target 
the enemy unit that just attacked it, and 
can only do so if that enemy unit is an 
eligible target. In addition, if a Necrons 
Character is leading your unit, until 
the end of the phase, ranged weapons 
equipped by models in your unit have the 
[IGNORES COVER] ability. 

1CP

1CP

At a hissing static signal, nanoscarabs 
are released in boiling black clouds 
that whirl about the legions and effect 
constant repairs.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has resolved its attacks.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from your 
army that had one or more of its models 
destroyed as a result of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit activates its 
Reanimation Protocols and reanimates 
D3 wounds. When doing so, if a Necrons 
Character is leading your unit, your unit 
reanimates D3+1 wounds instead.

PROTOCOL OF THE SUDDEN STORM

AWAKENED DYNASTY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Arcing energies leap from one Necron unit 
to the next, lending speed to their limbs 
and causing their eye lenses to blaze.

WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, ranged 
weapons equipped by models in your unit 
have the [ASSAULT] ability. In addition, if a 
Necrons Character is leading your unit, 
until the end of the phase, you can re-roll 
Advance rolls made for your unit.

through a miracle of arcane science.

Necrons model only. Once per battle, at the end of 
your opponent’s turn, if the bearer’s unit is not within 
Engagement Range of any enemy units, the bearer 
can use this Enhancement. If it does, remove that 
unit from the battlefield. Then, in the Reinforcements 
step of your next Movement phase, set up that unit 
anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" 
horizontally away from all enemy models.
HYPERMATERIAL ABLATOR
By simply pointing and activating this slender 
quasinium rod, the bearer shrouds their allies in a 
whirling field of accumulated hypermatter.

Necrons model only. While the bearer is leading 
a unit, models in that unit have the Stealth ability. 
In addition, each time a ranged attack targets the 
bearer’s unit, if the attacker is not within 12", models 
in that unit have the Benefit of Cover.

Necrons model only. While a friendly Necrons unit 
is within 6" of the bearer, that unit counts as being led 
by a Necrons Character model.

Designer’s Note: This means that units within range 
of this Aura ability will benefit from the Command 
Protocols ability and will count as containing a 
Character for the purposes of any Awakened 
Dynasty Stratagems.
SEMPITERNAL WEAVE
Only the finest Cryptek artificers know the secret of 
crafting a Sempiternal Weave. These gossamer-thin 
plates are formed from phase-hardened amarathine 
and threads of adamantine. They are then layered 
over the bearer’s carapace of living metal, stiffening 
and contracting when struck to turn aside energy 
blades, bolt shells and even the searing heat of a 
plasma burst.

Necrons model only. The bearer has the 
Feel No Pain 4+ ability.

Some Crypteks are accompanied by bound Cryptothralls that act 
as slaves and bodyguards. These hunched and sinister beings are 
not truly sentient, but are rather construct creatures enslaved to the 
Cryptek’s will and engrammatically compelled to protect their master 
with their living metal bodies and fierce, short-ranged weaponry.

CRYPTEK RETINUE

At the start of the Declare Battle Formations step, this unit 
can join one other unit from your army that is being led by a 
Cryptek Infantry model (a unit cannot have more than one 
Cryptothralls unit joined to it). If it does, until the end of the 
battle, every model in this unit counts as being part of that 
Bodyguard unit, and that Bodyguard unit’s Starting Strength is

races. This vehicle is solely dedicated to overwhelming long-ranged 
firepower, even diverting energy from its motive functions in order to 
unleash absolute obliteration upon the foe.
