THOUSAND SONS
ARMY RULE

The Thousand Sons channel their arcane power through battlefield ritual, beseeching the Changer of the Ways to 
gift them forbidden knowledge or ravage their foes with warpfire and mutation.

CABAL OF SORCERERS
If your Army Faction is Thousand Sons, at the end of your Command phase, each model from your army with 
this ability that is on the battlefield (excluding Battle-shocked models) generates you a number of Cabal points 
equal to the number shown in its ability (e.g. a model with the Cabal of Sorcerers 2 ability would generate you 
2 Cabal points). The combined total of these is your Cabal points pool. During the battle round, you can use 
Rituals from the list below, deducting the Cabal points cost of each one from your Cabal points pool. If you do 
not have enough Cabal points for a Ritual, you cannot use it. Each Ritual can only be used once per phase. At the 
start of your next Command phase, your Cabal points pool resets to zero. Each time you use a Ritual, select one 
Thousand Sons Psyker model from your army, then apply that Ritual’s effect using that Psyker.

WEAVER OF FATES (PSYCHIC)
2 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Once during 
that phase, when a saving throw is failed for a friendly 
Thousand Sons model whose unit is within 18" of 
this Psyker, you can re-roll that saving throw.

ECHOES FROM THE WARP (PSYCHIC)
6 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Once this 
phase, you can select this Psyker’s unit as the target 
of a Stratagem for 0CP, even if you have already used 
that Stratagem this phase.

TEMPORAL SURGE (PSYCHIC)
5 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of your Shooting phase. 
Select one friendly Thousand Sons unit within 18" 
of this Psyker; unless that unit is within Engagement 
Range of one or more enemy units, it can make a 
Normal move. If it does, that unit is not eligible to 
declare a charge this turn.

DOOMBOLT (PSYCHIC)
7 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of your Shooting phase. 
Select one enemy unit within 18" of and visible to 
this Psyker and roll one D6: on a 1, that enemy unit 
suffers D3 mortal wounds; on a 2-5, it suffers D3+3 
mortal wounds; on a 6, it suffers D3+6 mortal wounds. 

TWIST OF FATE (PSYCHIC)
9 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Select one 
enemy unit within 18" of and visible to this Psyker; 
until the end of the phase, armour saving throws 
cannot be made for models in that unit.

THOUSAND SONS – CULT OF MAGIC
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Thousand Sons, you can use 
this Cult of Magic Detachment rule.

KINDRED SORCERY
For an instant, the chanting voices of the Thousand 
Sons achieve perfect synchronisation, words of 
malign incantation rolling out like the peal of 
some cursed bell amidst the empyrean.

In your Command phase, you can select 
one of the abilities listed below to 
take effect until the start of your next 
Command phase.

MALEVOLENT CHARGE
Psychic weapons equipped by 
Thousand Sons models from your army 
have the [LETHAL HITS] ability.

PSYCHIC MAELSTROM

Sons models from your army have the 
[SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

WRATH OF THE IMMATERIUM
Psychic weapons equipped by Thousand

If you are using the Cult of Magic Detachment rule, you can use these Cult of Magic Stratagems.

1CP

SORCEROUS MIGHT
CULT OF MAGIC – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

unit from your army that has not been

from your army and one enemy unit that 
is visible to that unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each

that attack has the [INDIRECT FIRE] and 
[IGNORES COVER] abilities. 

THOUSAND SONS – CULT OF MAGIC
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Cult of Magic Detachment rule, you can use these Cult of Magic Enhancements.
LORD OF FORBIDDEN LORE
This sorcerer has committed many a grimoire and 
unholy tome to memory, giving him unparalleled 
knowledge of hexes, curses and destructive rites.

UMBRALEFIC CRYSTAL
By siphoning the perpetual gloom from the location 
where the cursed planet Mangel III once existed in 
realspace, a cabal of sorcerers from the Cult of Magic 
created the Umbralefic Crystal. One in command of 
this powerful relic can use its energies to temporarily 
fold space, creating a gate of sorcerous translocation 
through which he or his allies can step.

Thousand Sons Psyker model only. The bearer can 
be selected to use a Ritual even if another Psyker 
from your army has already been selected to use that 
Ritual this phase.
ATHENAEAN SCROLLS
Ahriman consumed the knowledge contained in 
the Athenaeum of Kallimakus long ago, but not all 
of the Athenaeum’s founders were slain when their 
repository of knowledge was destroyed. Some of their 
lore has since been transcribed to keep an echo of 
that great library in existence. One who possesses 
these texts has access to techniques that make his 
spells exceptionally potent.

Thousand Sons Psyker model only. In your 
Command phase, if the bearer is on the battlefield and 
is not Battle-shocked, it generates you 1 additional 
Cabal point this phase. 

Thousand Sons model only. Once per battle, in your 
Command phase, you can remove the bearer’s unit 
from the battlefield. If you do, in the Reinforcements 
step of your next Movement phase, set that unit back 
up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" 
horizontally away from all enemy models. 
ARCANE VORTEX
This ritualistic locus is formed from the matter of 
arcane objects, their substance broken down at 
a molecular level and added to a nexus of energy 
surrounding the creator. When battle is joined, the 
sorcerer draws upon this power, all the better to 
unleash warp-fuelled destruction upon the enemy.

Thousand Sons model only. Add 1 to the Strength 
and Damage characteristics of Psychic weapons 
equipped by the bearer.
