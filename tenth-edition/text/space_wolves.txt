SPACE WOLVES – CHAMPIONS OF RUSS
DETACHMENT RULE

The Space Wolves are a savage Space Marine Chapter 
of merciless hunters. They hail from the icy death 
world of Fenris and strive to emulate the strength, 
cunning and howling ferocity of their Primarch: 
Leman Russ, the Wolf King. In their pursuits of the 
enemies of Mankind across the Sea of Stars, the 
Space Wolves employ the advanced technology and 
deadly weapons of the Adeptus Astartes under a skin 
of seemingly feral barbarity. With audacious boasts, 
the taking of impetuous risks and the joyful roars 
of warriors born, the Space Wolves are a Chapter of 
heroes who wage war without fear or doubt, each 
seeking to forge a saga worthy of immortalisation.

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can 
use this Champions of Russ Detachment rule.

feats of daring and valour, determined to prove themselves worthy of their champions.

zone at the end of either player’s turn during the 
battle round, and one or more Adeptus Astartes

Control characteristic of Adeptus Astartes models 
from your army by 1.

1CP

RUNIC WARDS

1CP

DEATH HOWL
CHAMPIONS OF RUSS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Having stalked their prey or run them 
to ground, all that remains is to go for 
the enemy’s weakest points, to rip them 
apart in a furious bloodletting. Onlookers 
are stricken with terror at the bloody 
spectacle, an instant before the sons of 
Russ pounce upon them.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army that destroyed one or more 
enemy units this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
each time a model in your unit makes 
a Consolidation move, it can move up 
to 6" instead of up to 3", provided your 
unit ends that Consolidation move in 
Unit Coherency and within Engagement 
Range of one or more enemy units. In 
addition, if the Saga of Majesty has been 
completed by your army, each enemy 
unit within 6" of your unit when it ends 
that Consolidation move must take a 
Battle-shock test.

1CP

WARRIOR PRIDE
CHAMPIONS OF RUSS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

The greatest champions amongst the

enemy, leading by example to uphold the 
honour of their Chapter.

WHEN: Your Command phase.

Character model from your army.
EFFECT: Select one Saga that has not 
yet been completed by your army. 
Until the end of the turn, models in your 
Character’s unit have the benefit of the 
selected Saga as if it had been completed 
by your army.

RELENTLESS ASSAULT
CHAMPIONS OF RUSS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Once their blades and claws run red with 
the enemy’s blood, nothing will hold the 
savage sons of Russ back from new prey.

WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after 
an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army 
makes a Fall Back or Advance move.
TARGET: That Adeptus Astartes unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit 
is eligible to shoot even though it Fell Back 
or Advanced this phase. If the Saga of the 
Warrior Born has been completed by your 
army, until the end of the turn, your unit is 
also eligible to declare a charge. 

SPACE WOLVES – CHAMPIONS OF RUSS
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Champions of Russ Detachment rule, you can use these Champions of Russ Enhancements.
THE PELT OF BALEWOLF
The pelts of wolves are plentiful trophies amongst 
the heroes of Fenris. However, some of these mantles 
are rare and steeped in legend, belonging to one 
of the near-mythical Blackmaned wolves. The Pelt 
of Balewolf came from a giant of its massive kind. 
Even now, when the name of its heroic slayer is 
barely recalled, Balewolf ’s raw spirit still permeates 
the long-dead creature’s pelt, a bestial aura that 
reaches into primitive fear centres. Even the mighty 
instinctively tremble before the wearer, sensing the 
presence of a terrifying alpha predator.

WOLF TAIL TALISMAN
Although seen by the sons of Russ as tokens of 
luck and protection against evil, wolf tail talismans 
are regarded by most outside the Chapters of Russ’ 
genetic legacy as trinkets of mere superstition. Yet 
whether through the power of the bearer’s belief, 
some attribute inherent in the creatures they are 
taken from or some stranger reason, these talismans 
appear to bestow the warrior with a measure of 
protection against malicious attacks.

Adeptus Astartes model only. At the start of the Fight 
phase, each enemy unit within Engagement Range of 
the bearer must take a Battle-shock test.
BLACK DEATH
The sagas of Torvald Fangbreaker, of Gerd the Bloody 
and many others detail the sickening monsters and 
fell champions slain by Black Death. They tell of how 
the runic enchantments etched into the ebon weapon 
glow darkly in battle, transforming the bearer into a 
relentless killing machine.

Adeptus Astartes model only. The bearer’s 
melee weapons have the [ANTI-MONSTER 4+] and 
[ANTI-VEHICLE 4+] abilities.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Each time an attack 
is allocated to the bearer, subtract 1 from the Damage 
characteristic of that attack.
FROST WEAPON
Amongst the most prized weapons of the sons of 
Russ – himself the Lord of Winter and War – these 
blisteringly cold weapons are specially crafted by 
a master Iron Priest. Some are wrought from the 
razor-sharp fangs of the Ice Kraken, while others 
are shards of energised diamond, giving them the 
appearance of blades forged from purest ice.

Adeptus Astartes model only. The bearer’s melee 
weapons have the [PRECISION] ability, and the 
Strength and Armour Penetration characteristics of 
those weapons are improved by 1.
