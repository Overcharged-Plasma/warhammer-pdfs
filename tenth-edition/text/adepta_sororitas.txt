ADEPTA SORORITAS
ARMY RULE

The Battle Sisters of the Adepta Sororitas bear the holy weaponry with which the Emperor’s legions conquered 
the galaxy, and illuminate the faithless in lethal volleys from the holy trinity of bolter, flamer and melta weapons. 
It is said the Emperor’s benediction touches each of these warriors, manifesting as a nimbus of holy light in 
which his power is revealed in miraculous deeds of fortitude and divine strength.

ACTS OF FAITH
If your Army Faction is Adepta Sororitas, each unit from your army with this ability can perform one Act of Faith 
per phase. This is done using Miracle dice.

GAINING MIRACLE DICE
If your Army Faction is Adepta Sororitas, you gain 1 
Miracle dice:

 ■ At the start of each turn.
 ■  Each time an Adepta Sororitas unit from your 

army is destroyed.

Each time you gain a Miracle dice, roll one D6. The 
number you roll is the value of that Miracle dice. This 
value cannot be changed or re-rolled, unless a rule 
specifically states otherwise. Keep your Miracle dice 
to one side – this is your Miracle dice pool. 

PERFORMING AN ACT OF FAITH
Before making a dice roll for a model or unit from your 
army with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one 
or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can 
perform an Act of Faith. If it does, select one of the 
dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that 
dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a 
Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can 
be substituted). The dice that is being substituted is 
not rolled; instead the value of the selected Miracle 
dice is used as if it had been rolled (this counts as 
an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules 
purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for 
substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions 
have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice 
from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, 
unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You 
can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of 
Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:

 ■  Advance roll
 ■ Battle-shock test
 ■ Charge roll
 ■ Damage roll
 ■ Hit roll
 ■ Saving throw
 ■ Wound roll

Example: Instead of rolling 2D6 to take a unit’s 
Battle-shock test, you could use one dice from 
your Miracle dice pool. If the value of that dice was 
4, the unit’s Battle-shock test would be determined 
by rolling one D6 and adding 4 to it (i.e. it would 
be D6+4).

ADEPTA SORORITAS – HALLOWED MARTYRS
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Adepta Sororitas, you can 
use this Hallowed Martyrs Detachment rule. 

THE BLOOD OF MARTYRS 
The blood of martyrs is the life force of the Imperium. 
So do the tenets of this Order joyously proclaim, and 
in its warriors’ darkest hour does the sacrifice of their 
fallen Sisters shine brightest. 

Each time an Adepta Sororitas model from your 
army makes an attack, add 1 to the Hit roll if that 
model’s unit is below its Starting Strength, and add 1 
to the Wound roll, as well, if that model’s unit is Below 
Half-strength. For the purposes of this ability, if a 
unit has a Starting Strength of 1, it is considered to 
be below its Starting Strength while it has lost one or 
more wounds.

ADEPTA SORORITAS – HALLOWED MARTYRS
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Hallowed Martyrs Detachment rule, you can use these Hallowed Martyrs Stratagems.

1CP

DIVINE INTERVENTION
HALLOWED MARTYRS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Sometimes, a brush with death is so close 
the only explanation is divine intervention.

WHEN: Any phase.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas 
Character unit from your army that 
was just destroyed. You can use this 
Stratagem on that unit even though it was 
just destroyed.
EFFECT: Discard 1-3 Miracle dice. At the 
end of the phase, set the last destroyed 
model from your unit back up on the 
battlefield, as close as possible to 
where it was destroyed and not within 
Engagement Range of any enemy models. 
That model is set back up with a number 
of wounds remaining equal to the number 
of Miracle dice you discarded.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select Saint 
Celestine as the target of this Stratagem. 
You cannot select the same Character 
as the target of this Stratagem more than 
once per battle. 

1CP

1CP

LIGHT OF THE EMPEROR
HALLOWED MARTYRS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The Emperor’s radiance shines upon his 
warriors, emboldening them amidst the 
thick of battle in their darkest hour.

WHEN: Command phase.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit 
from your army that is below its Starting 
Strength. For the purposes of this 
Stratagem, if a unit has a Starting Strength 
of 1, it is considered to be below its 
Starting Strength while it has lost one or 
more wounds.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your 
unit can ignore any or all modifiers to 
its characteristics and/or to any roll or 
test made for it (excluding modifiers to 
saving throws).

HOLY RAGE
HALLOWED MARTYRS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

With psalms on their lips, the faithful hurl 
themselves forward, striking the foe down 
with the inner strength born of faith in 
the Emperor.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes a melee 
attack, add 1 to the Wound roll.

ADEPTA SORORITAS – HALLOWED MARTYRS
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Hallowed Martyrs Detachment rule, you can use these Hallowed Martyrs Stratagems.

REJOICE THE FALLEN
HALLOWED MARTYRS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

The death of a Battle Sister only stirs 
the survivors to fight harder to exact 
swift vengeance.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has resolved 
its attacks.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit 
from your army that had one or more of 
its models destroyed as a result of the 
attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit can shoot as if it were 
your Shooting phase, but it must target 
only that enemy unit when doing so, and 
can only do so if that enemy unit is an 
eligible target.

2CP

SPIRIT OF THE MARTYR
HALLOWED MARTYRS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Even with their dying act, the Sororitas 
mete out the Emperor’s judgement.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if 
that model has not fought this phase, do 
not remove it from play. The destroyed 
model can fight after the attacking 
model’s unit has finished making attacks, 
and is then removed from play.

SUFFERING & SACRIFICE

HALLOWED MARTYRS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Suffering is a staple prayer for the Adepta 
Sororitas, and a martyr’s fate only brings 
greater glory to the God-Emperor.

WHEN: Start of the Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas Infantry 
or Adepta Sororitas Walker unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an enemy model within Engagement 
range of your unit selects targets, it must 
select your unit as the target of its attacks.

ADEPTA SORORITAS – HALLOWED MARTYRS
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Hallowed Martyrs Detachment rule, you can use these Hallowed Martyrs Enhancements.
SAINTLY EXAMPLE
With her final breath is another heroine elevated to 
the ranks of sainthood, her death stirring her greatest 
companions to finish what she started.

Adepta Sororitas model only. When the bearer is 
destroyed, you gain an additional D3 Miracle dice.
BLADE OF SAINT ELLYNOR
This blade is forged from thrice-blessed silver, 
quenched in the blood of a hundred martyred heroes. 
On one side the names and deeds of a thousand 
saints are inscribed on the molecular level, while the 
other side is etched with the entire Fede Imperialis. 
The blade glows with righteous power and has slain 
heretics, mutants and xenos beyond counting.

Adepta Sororitas model only. Add 1 to the 
Attacks, Strength and Damage characteristics of 
the bearer’s melee weapons. If the bearer has lost 
one or more wounds, add 2 to the Attacks, Strength 
and Damage characteristics of the bearer’s melee 
weapons instead. 

LITANIES OF FAITH
When Sebastian Thor was declared Ecclesiarch in 
the wake of the Age of Apostasy, his first sermon 
was transcribed onto scrolls by an army of scribes. 
Today, only a single original copy remains, kept in a 
stasis vault beneath the Convent Prioris on Terra and 
released only with the sanction of the Ecclesiarch 
himself. This unassuming parchment is one of the 
holiest relics in the Ministorum’s charge, its mere 
presence enough to fill the hearts of the faithful with 
righteous fervour.

Adepta Sororitas model only. At the end of your 
Command phase, if the bearer is on the battlefield, 
you can re-roll one Miracle dice from your Miracle dice 
pool and return it to your Miracle dice pool with the 
new result you rolled. When doing so, if the bearer has 
lost one or more wounds or is leading a unit that is 
Below Half-strength, you can re-roll up to three Miracle 
dice in this way instead.
MANTLE OF OPHELIA
The Mantle of Ophelia was once the badge of office 
for the Prioress of the Convent Sanctorum, and was 
worn by Helena the Virtuous, a Living Saint and one of 
the most revered leaders in the history of the Adepta 
Sororitas. The mantle is thought to have sacred 
powers of protection, for Helena was said to have 
anointed it with the Tears of the Emperor, a phial of 
blood-like liquid meticulously collected over a century 
from weeping statues of the Emperor found across 
the cardinal worlds of the Imperium.

Canoness or Palatine model only. Each time an 
attack is allocated to the bearer, change the Damage 
characteristic of that attack to 1.
