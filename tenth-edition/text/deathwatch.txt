DEATHWATCH
ARMY RULES

From their hidden bases in orbiting watch fortresses, the Deathwatch dispatch carefully selected operatives to 
hunt down and exterminate alien presences wherever they may be found. Each of these post-human warriors 
is a veteran of countless battles, tithed by their original Chapter to undertake the Long Vigil and guard against 
alien incursion. 

KILL TEAMS
When faced with an array of missions to complete 
and varying enemies to lay low, the Deathwatch are 
highly adept at forming effective kill teams that mesh 
starkly diverse armour and equipment.

Each time an attack targets a Kill Team unit from 
your army that contains models with different 
Toughness characteristics, until the attacking unit 
has finished making its attacks, use the Toughness 
characteristic of the majority of the models in that 
unit when determining what roll is required for 
that attack to successfully wound. If two or more 
Toughness characteristics are tied for majority, use 
the highest value. 

For the purposes of determining which models 
can embark within a Transport model, Kill Team 
Terminator models, Kill Team Outrider models, Kill 
Team Biker models and models equipped with a jump 
pack each take up the space of 2 models, but can 
otherwise embark within any Transport their unit 
can embark within, even though similar models in 
other units may have the Terminator, Mounted or 
Jump Pack keywords. 

For the purposes of interacting with terrain features, 
all models in units with the Kill Team ability are 
treated as Infantry, even though similar models 
in other units may have the Mounted or Jump 
Pack keywords.

Designer’s Note: While the slight abstractions in the above 
rules cause some models to behave differently to similar 
models in other units, they are designed to minimise unusual 
or complicated movement, Transport and Benefit of 
Cover effects.

DEATHWATCH – BLACK SPEAR TASK FORCE 
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can 
use this Black Spear Task Force Detachment rule. 

RESTRICTIONS
 ■  Your army can include Deathwatch units, but it 

cannot include any Adeptus Astartes units drawn 
from any other Chapter.

 ■  Your army cannot include any of the following units: 
Assault Squad; Assault Squad with Jump Packs; 
Attack Bike Squad; Devastator Squad; Land 
Speeder Storm; Scout Squad; Scout Sniper 
Squad; Tactical Squad.

MISSION TACTICS
Thousands of years of collated strategic data and 
hard-won combat experience have provided the 
Deathwatch with the ultimate battlefield tactics to 
combat almost any foe.

At the start of your Command phase, you can select 
one of the Mission Tactics listed below. Until the start 
of your next Command phase, that Mission Tactic 
is active and its effects apply to all units from your 
army with this ability. Each Mission Tactic can only be 
selected once per battle.

FUROR TACTICS
When the enemy horde grows close, the Deathwatch 
will be tasked with the decimation of their core. 
Aiming not for clinical kills but for maximum 
destruction over a wide area, they tear the heart from 
the enemy army.

While this Mission Tactic is active, weapons equipped 
by Adeptus Astartes units from your army have the 
[SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

MALLEUS TACTICS
When the giants of war lumber forth, the Deathwatch 
will adopt Malleus tactics. Even the largest behemoth 
has a weak point, and the archives of the Deathwatch 
number them all.

While this Mission Tactic is active, weapons equipped 
by Adeptus Astartes units from your army have the 
[LETHAL HITS] ability.

PURGATUS TACTICS
By adopting Purgatus tactics, the Deathwatch focus 
their deadly ire upon the commanders of the enemy 
host, assassinating them one after another with 
pitiless head shots and killing thrusts of the blade. 

While this Mission Tactic is active, each time an 
Adeptus Astartes unit from your army makes an 
attack, if a Critical Hit is scored, that attack has the 
[PRECISION] ability.

DEATHWATCH – BLACK SPEAR TASK FORCE

If you are using the Black Spear Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Black Spear Task 
Force Stratagems.

has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking

Astartes unit your army.
EFFECT: For each unit targeted, select the

DEATHWATCH – BLACK SPEAR TASK FORCE
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Black Spear Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Black Spear Task 
Force Enhancements. 
THIEF OF SECRETS
The Thief of Secrets is a blade whose machine 
spirit has an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. 
It has tasted the vitae of countless alien races, 
absorbing those liquids through auto-sanctified 
sanguinator-channels and codifying them through 
the honeycombed array of logicum cells within. The 
biological secrets of many xenos races have thus 
been laid bare, allowing the blade’s user to modulate 
its power field, the better to slice through chitinous 
armour, rupture xenoform organs and burn out alien 
nervous systems.

BEACON ANGELIS
The Beacon Angelis was devised to guide the 
Deathwatch to the threshold of the alien adversary. 
Housed within a reliquary, it calls out to the warriors’ 
augur arrays with the voices of a hundred electric 
cherubim, its summons so strong that it draws the 
righteous unto its locale regardless of what darkness 
may surround it.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Models in the bearer’s 
unit have the Deep Strike ability. In addition, you 
can target the bearer’s unit with the Rapid Ingress 
Stratagem for 0CP.
THE TOME OF ECTOCLADES
This grimoire, bound in the skin of the alien, holds 
the most powerful truths the Deathwatch have 
uncovered about their foes, whether xenos or those 
who harbour them. On occasion, such knowledge has 
been known to save not only the book’s custodian, 
but entire worlds.

Watch Master or Captain model only. Once per 
battle, after you have selected an enemy unit using 
the Oath of Moment ability in your Command phase, 
the bearer can use this Enhancement if they are on 
the battlefield. When they do, select a second enemy 
unit – until the start of your next Command phase, 
each time an Adeptus Astartes model from your 
army makes an attack that targets either of those 
enemy units, you can re-roll the Hit roll and you can 
re-roll the Wound roll.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Improve the Strength, 
Damage and Armour Penetration characteristics of 
the bearer’s melee weapons by 1. If an enemy model 
is destroyed as the result of a melee attack made by 
the bearer, at the end of that phase, until the end of 
the battle, improve the Strength, Damage and Armour 
Penetration characteristics of the bearer’s melee 
weapons by 2 instead.
OSSEUS KEY
The ancient clavis known as the Osseus Key is said 
to be the most powerful of its kind. Where other such 
devices are made from sanctified platinum, the 
Osseus Key is made from the hand and finger bones 
of deceased Imperial Fists heroes that fought in the 
Horus Heresy, scrimshawed with inhuman care and 
imbued with the fiercest machine spirits of the age. 
No portal can bar its bearer from entry, and no xenos 
machine can stand before his wrath.

Watch Master or Techmarine model only. At the 
start of your opponent’s Shooting phase, select one 
enemy Vehicle unit (excluding Titanic units) within 
12" of and visible to the bearer. That model must take 
a Leadership test. If that test is passed, until the end 
of the phase, each time a model in that unit makes an 
attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll; if that test is failed, 
that unit is not eligible to shoot this phase.
