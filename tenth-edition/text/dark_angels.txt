DARK ANGELS – UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE
DETACHMENT RULE

No matter the foe or the odds, the proud warriors of 
the Dark Angels stubbornly refuse to accept defeat. 
None fight with more grim determination than 
the battle-brothers of the Dark Angels, and their 
renowned specialised companies – the Deathwing 
and Ravenwing – are held in awe by their allies and 
enemies alike.

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can 
use this Unforgiven Task Force Detachment rule.

RESTRICTIONS
 ■  Your army can include Dark Angels units, but it 

cannot include any Adeptus Astartes units drawn 
from any other Chapter.

GRIM RESOLVE
The Dark Angels are renowned for their unshakeable 
resolve, enduring tenacity and strict discipline in 
battle. They are tactically astute, able to prosecute 
their wars on any front. On the offence, they strike 
with all the martial pride of the Lion, while in defence 
they are stalwart, determined to accomplish their 
mission no matter the cost.

While an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army 
is Battle-shocked, change the Objective Control 
characteristic of models in that unit to 1, instead of 0.

DARK ANGELS – UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Unforgiven Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Unforgiven Task 
Force Stratagems.

1CP

UNFORGIVEN FURY

UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – BATTLE  
TACTIC STRATAGEM

With focused aggression, the Dark Angels 
relentlessly punish the foe.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the 
Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
shoot or fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
weapons equipped by models in your 
unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability. In 
addition, if one or more Adeptus Astartes 
units from your army are currently 
Battle-shocked, until the end of the phase, 
each time a model in your unit makes an 
attack, a successful unmodified Hit roll of 
5+ scores a Critical Hit.

INTRACTABLE
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – STRATEGIC  
PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Although stubborn warriors, even the 
resolute Dark Angels know that a fighting 
retreat can be the wisest course of action.

WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after 
an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army 
Falls Back.
TARGET: That Adeptus Astartes unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, that unit 
is eligible to shoot and declare a charge, 
even though it Fell Back this phase.

1CP

ARMOUR OF CONTEMPT
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – BATTLE  
TACTIC STRATAGEM

The belligerency of the Adeptus Astartes 
combined with their transhuman 
physiology makes them unyielding foes 
to face.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, worsen 
the Armour Penetration characteristic of 
that attack by 1.

FIRE DISCIPLINE
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC 
STRATAGEM

1CP

There is no escaping the Unforgiven’s 
wrath when they bring their disciplined 
firepower to bear.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
shoot this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, ranged 
weapons equipped by models in that 
unit have the [ASSAULT], [HEAVY] and 
[IGNORES COVER] abilities.

If you are using the Unforgiven Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Unforgiven Task 
Force Stratagems.

1CP

GRIM RETRIBUTION
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – STRATEGIC  
PLOY STRATAGEM

The Dark Angels are renowned for yielding 
nothing to the enemy, and fighting back 
with unanswerable fury in the face of 
odds that would force even other Adeptus 
Astartes to reconsider their position.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has shot.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army that had one or more models 
destroyed as a result of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit can shoot as if it were 
your Shooting phase, but it must target 
the enemy unit that just attacked it, and 
can only do so if that enemy unit is an 
eligible target.

UNBREAKABLE LINES
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC 
STRATAGEM

1CP

Countless assaults have faltered against 
the unbreakable ceramite wall that is the 
Unforgiven standing their ground.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Charge phase, just 
after an enemy unit ends a Charge move.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army within Engagement Range of 
that enemy unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, each 
time an attack is allocated to a model in 
your unit, subtract 1 from the Damage 
characteristic of that attack.

DARK ANGELS – UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Unforgiven Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Unforgiven Task 
Force Enhancements.
SHROUD OF HEROES
When one of the Dark Angels’ mightiest warriors is 
slain in battle, his recovered remains are wrapped 
in a death shroud until he can be interred within the 
crypts of the Lion’s Sanctum. Pieces of this fabric are 
then stitched into a single set of robes known as the 
Shroud of Heroes, and those who wear it claim they 
can feel the powers of their predecessors refusing to 
let them yield while their duty remains unfulfilled.

HEAVENFALL BLADE
This weapon was bestowed upon the most 
honourable Knight of the Order before a long quest 
into the wilds of Caliban. Its blade is empowered 
by a force generator of magnificent strength. It is a 
weighty responsibility to bear such an heirloom into 
battle, and a Dark Angel bestowed such an honour 
would rather die than bring shame to his Chapter.

Adeptus Astartes model only. The first time the 
bearer is destroyed, roll one D6 at the end of the 
phase. On a 2+, set the bearer back up on the 
battlefield as close as possible to where it was 
destroyed and not within Engagement Range of any 
enemy units, with 3 wounds remaining (if the bearer 
was Battle-shocked when it was destroyed, it is 
instead returned with its full wounds remaining).
STUBBORN TENACITY
Even for a Chapter as famously stubborn as the Dark 
Angels, this warrior is known for his intractable nature. 
Such tenacity and dedication to duty is an inspiration 
to the warriors who follow him – so fortified, enemy 
attempts to break them only strengthen their resolve.

Adeptus Astartes model only. While the bearer is 
leading a unit, each time a model in that unit makes 
an attack, add 1 to the Hit roll if the bearer’s unit is 
below its Starting Strength, and add 1 to the Wound 
roll as well if the bearer’s unit is Battle-shocked.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Add 1 to the 
Attacks, Strength and Damage characteristics of 
the bearer’s melee weapons. While the bearer is 
Battle-shocked, add 2 to the Attacks, Strength 
and Damage characteristics of the bearer’s melee 
weapons instead.
PENNANT OF REMEMBRANCE
This hallowed banner records the names and deeds 
of the legendary members of the Deathwing that the 
company’s bone-coloured armour commemorates. 
The legacy of those mighty warriors is one of bravery 
and defiance in the face of overwhelming odds. 
Under the shadow of their example, every member 
of the Chapter fights on through grievous injury 
to prove themselves worthy successors of such 
martial paragons.

Bladeguard Ancient, Primaris Ancient or 
Terminator Ancient model only. While the 
bearer is leading a unit, models in that unit 
have the Feel No Pain 6+ ability. While that unit 
is Battle-shocked, models in that unit have the 
Feel No Pain 4+ ability instead.
