CHAOS DAEMONS
ARMY RULE

When daemons pour into realspace, maelstroms of warp energy spill through in their wake. Manifest emotion 
and unbridled, nightmarish forces twist all that they touch, reshaping the landscape into bizarre forms while 
tormenting mortal beings to madness. To be embroiled in such tempests is to endure conditions utterly 
anathema to the fundamental laws of reality, provoking primal terror in even the most emotionless warriors.

THE SHADOW OF CHAOS
If your Army Faction is Legiones Daemonica, certain 
areas of the battlefield are considered to be within 
your army’s Shadow of Chaos, as follows: 

 ■  Your deployment zone is always within your army’s 

Shadow of Chaos. 

 ■  At the start of any phase, if you control at least half 
of the objective markers within No Man’s Land, until 
the end of that phase, No Man’s Land is within your 
army’s Shadow of Chaos.

 ■  At the start of any phase, if you control at least half 

of the objective markers within your opponent’s 
deployment zone, until the end of that phase, your 
opponent’s deployment zone is within your army’s 
Shadow of Chaos.

DAEMONIC MANIFESTATION
While a Legiones Daemonica unit from your army is 
within your army’s Shadow of Chaos, each time that 
unit takes a Battle-shock test, add 1 to that test and, 
if that test is passed, one model in that unit regains 
up to D3 lost wounds (if that unit is a Battleline unit 
and that test is passed, up to D3 destroyed models 
can be returned to that unit instead).

DAEMONIC TERROR
While an enemy unit is within your army’s Shadow of 
Chaos, each time that unit takes a Battle-shock test, 
subtract 1 from that test and, if that test is failed, that 
enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

 DAEMONIC PACT
When the mortal servants of the Dark Gods 
march to war, the most favoured may find 
daemonic entities accompanying them.

If every model from your army has the 
Chaos keyword, you can include Legiones 
Daemonica units in your army, even if they 
do not have the Faction keyword you selected 
in the Select Army Faction step. The combined 
points cost of such units you can include 
depends on your battle size, as shown below.

 ■ Incursion   
 ■ Strike Force 
 ■ Onslaught  

Up to 250 pts
Up to 500 pts
Up to 750 pts

None of these models can be your Warlord, 
and they cannot be given Enhancements. 
In addition:

 ■ I f your Army Faction is World Eaters, 

you can only include Khorne Legiones 
Daemonica units using these rules.

 ■  If your Army Faction is Thousand Sons, 

you can only include Tzeentch Legiones 
Daemonica units using these rules.

 ■  If your Army Faction is Death Guard, 

you can only include Nurgle Legiones 
Daemonica units using these rules.

 ■  If your Warlord is Lucius the Eternal, 
you can only include Slaanesh Legiones 
Daemonica units using these rules.

CHAOS DAEMONS – DAEMONIC INCURSION
DETACHMENT RULES

If your Army Faction is Legiones Daemonica, you 
can use this Daemonic Incursion Detachment rule.

WARP RIFTS
Daemonic legions tear through the fabric of 
realspace, malevolent entities flickering into being 
like phantasms from a nightmare. Worse still, as 
terror and panic take hold of their victims, so their 
mortal souls become ever easier prey for the entities 
pouring through from the warp.

Each time a Legiones Daemonica unit from your 
army is set up on the battlefield using the Deep 
Strike ability, if it is set up wholly within your army’s 
Shadow of Chaos, it can be set up anywhere that 
is more than 6" horizontally away from all enemy 
models, instead of more than 9".

CHAOS DAEMONS – DAEMONIC INCURSION
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Daemonic Incursion Detachment rule, you can use these Daemonic 
Incursion Stratagems.

CORRUPT REALSPACE
DAEMONIC INCURSION – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Daemons instinctively feel the need 
to despoil and corrupt every corner of 
realspace, the better to sustain their 
otherworldly forms.

WHEN: Start of any Command phase.
TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica unit 
from your army that is within range of an 
objective marker you control.
EFFECT: That objective marker is said to 
be Corrupted and remains under your 
control, even if you have no models within 
range of it, until your opponent controls it 
at the start or end of any turn. In addition, 
while an objective marker is Corrupted 
and under your control, the area of the 
battlefield within 6" of that objective 
marker is considered to be within your 
army’s Shadow of Chaos. 

WARP SURGE
DAEMONIC INCURSION – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

The winds of the warp blow strong, 
invigorating daemonkind and lending 
them supernatural speed and ferocity.

WHEN: Your Charge phase.
TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica unit 
from your army that is within your army’s 
Shadow of Chaos.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your 
unit is eligible to declare a charge even if it 
Advanced this turn.

1CP

DRAUGHT OF TERROR
DAEMONIC INCURSION – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The swelling fear of their mortal prey serves 
as an intoxicating elixir to the daemonic 
followers, each draught invigorating their 
forms with deadly power.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the 
Fight phase.
TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica 
unit from your army that has not been 
selected to shoot or fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
improve the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of weapons equipped by 
models in that unit by 1. In addition, 
until the end of the phase, each time 
such a weapon targets a unit that is 
Battle-shocked, you can re-roll the 
Wound roll.

DENIZENS OF THE WARP
DAEMONIC INCURSION – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Ever lurking in the warp, daemons will 
wait until the barriers between realms thin 
before tearing their way into realspace. 

WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica unit 
from your army that is arriving using the 
Deep Strike ability this phase.
EFFECT: Your unit can be set up anywhere 
on the battlefield that is more than 3" 
horizontally away from all enemy models.
RESTRICTIONS: A unit targeted by this 
Stratagem is not eligible to declare a 
charge in the same turn.

CHAOS DAEMONS – DAEMONIC INCURSION
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Daemonic Incursion Detachment rule, you can use these Daemonic 
Incursion Stratagems.

1CP

THE REALM OF CHAOS
DAEMONIC INCURSION – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

When the energies of the warp bleed into 
realspace, the Legiones Daemonica can rip 
open portals in seeming thin-air, returning 
to their hellscapes only to rematerialise 
amidst their foes a heartbeat later.

WHEN: End of your opponent’s turn.
TARGET: Up to two Legiones Daemonica 
units from your army that are within 
your army’s Shadow of Chaos, or one 
other Legiones Daemonica unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Remove the targeted units 
from the battlefield and place them into 
Strategic Reserves. They will arrive back 
on the battlefield in the Reinforcements 
step of your next Movement phase using 
the Deep Strike ability.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot target units 
that are within Engagement Range of one 
or more enemy units with this Stratagem.

1CP

DAEMONIC INVULNERABILITY
DAEMONIC INCURSION – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Daemons are madness given form. Their 
very bodies are fashioned from the stuff 
of the warp, and are difficult to destroy 
through conventional means. 

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has selected 
its targets.
TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica unit 
from your army that was selected as 
the target of one or more of that enemy 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an invulnerable saving throw is made 
for a model in your unit, re-roll a saving 
throw of 1.

CHAOS DAEMONS – DAEMONIC INCURSION
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Daemonic Incursion Detachment rule, you can use these Daemonic 
Incursion Enhancements.
A’RGATH, THE KING OF BLADES
When a daemon is bound within a weapon by its 
infernal master, it rarely submits willingly to this 
terrible incarceration. The same cannot be said for 
A’rgath. A lifetime of slaughter and zealous dedication 
saw this butcher granted daemonhood. Such was 
his devotion to Khorne that instead of accepting 
immortality as a Daemon Prince, he instead chose 
to take the form of a deadly blade so that he could 
spill the lifeblood of Khorne’s greatest enemies. Their 
hand guided by A’rgath’s spirit, this weapon’s wielder 
becomes nigh on unstoppable. Countless are the 
rival champions and mortal heroes that have fallen 
to his power.

THE ENDLESS GIFT
Only the most accomplished plague daemons are 
granted the Endless Gift. A disease of unutterable 
malignancy and repulsive beneficence, it changes 
form constantly from plague to infestation to malaise. 
The one constant is its ability to reknit its sufferer’s 
corporeal form from even the most catastrophic of 
wounds. One moment, infernal bacteria may multiply 
like wildfire until their gelid mass fills a fleshy rent 
with fresh daemon-flesh. The next, pestilential 
vapours may billow from the daemon’s yawning 
maw, veiling its ravaged bulk before tattering away to 
reveal a form healed of its recent hurts.

Khorne Legiones Daemonica model only. Add 1 
to the Attacks and Strength characteristics of the 
bearer’s melee weapons. While the bearer is within 
your army’s Shadow of Chaos, add 2 to the Attacks 
and Strength characteristics of the bearer’s melee 
weapons instead.
THE EVERSTAVE
This staff blazes with vibrant warpflame. As soon as 
its master takes up the eldritch weapon, they too are 
wreathed in the same daemonic fire. From within this 
magenta inferno, the Everstave’s daemonic bearer 
hurls searing gouts of Tzeentch’s pink fire, turning 
armour to ash and immolating or irrevocably mutating 
the flesh beneath.

Tzeentch Legiones Daemonica model only. Add 1 
to the Strength characteristic of the bearer’s ranged 
weapons and increase the Range characteristic 
of such weapons by 3". While the bearer is within 
your army’s Shadow of Chaos, add 2 to the Strength 
characteristic of the bearer’s ranged weapons and 
increase the Range characteristic of such weapons 
by 6" instead.

Nurgle Legiones Daemonica model only. The bearer 
has the Feel No Pain 5+ ability. While the bearer is 
within your army’s Shadow of Chaos, the bearer has 
the Feel No Pain 4+ ability instead.
SOULSTEALER
This gluttonous blade gulps down the souls of its 
victims before invigorating the corporeal form of its 
wielder. Its greed stems from the starving Keeper of 
Secrets bound within – an arrogant entity that sought 
to devour enough Aeldari souls to challenge Slaanesh 
itself. As punishment for the daemon’s monstrous 
hubris, Slaanesh trapped it within Soulstealer, 
condemning the Keeper of Secrets to sustain other 
daemons with its frenzied appetite while retaining 
nothing for itself.

Slaanesh Legiones Daemonica model only. Each 
time the bearer destroys an enemy model with a 
melee attack, roll one D6, adding 1 to the result if the 
bearer is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos. On a 
4+, the bearer regains 1 lost wound.
