DREADBLADES 
Dreadblades often wander the galaxy, carving 
a path of destruction and slaughtering foes 
alongside other forces of Chaos as and when 
they will.

If every model in your army has the Chaos 
keyword, you can include either 1 Titanic 
Chaos Knights model or up to 3 War Dog 
models in your army, even if they do not have 
the Faction keyword you selected in the Select 
Army Faction step. None of these models 
can be your Warlord, and they cannot be 
given Enhancements. 

CHAOS KNIGHTS
ARMY RULES

Where Chaos Knights tread, the skies grow 
unnaturally dark and the dread of the warp permeates 
the battlefield. None are immune to its shadowy 
touch, for those it does not paralyse with fear 
and despair are wracked with hallucinations and 
driven mad.

HARBINGERS OF DREAD
If your Army Faction is Chaos Knights, each model 
from your army with this ability gains a bonus 
depending on which Dread abilities are active for 
your army (see below). Once a Dread ability is active 
for your army, that ability applies until the end of 
the battle.

BATTLE ROUND  1  ONWARDS

From the first battle round onwards, the Despair 
ability is active for your army:

DESPAIR (AURA)
While an enemy unit is within 12" of this model, 
each time that enemy unit takes a Battle-shock or 
Leadership test, subtract 1 from that test.

BATTLE ROUND  3  ONWARDS

From the third battle round onwards, the Doom and 
Darkness ability is active for your army:

DOOM AND DARKNESS
 ■  Each time this model makes an attack, if the target 

is Battle-shocked, add 1 to the Wound roll. 

 ■  Each time an attack targets this model, if the 

attacking model’s unit is Battle-shocked, subtract 1 
from the Hit roll. 

SUPER-HEAVY WALKER
Each time a model with this ability makes a Normal, 
Advance or Fall Back move, it can move over models 
(excluding Titanic models) and terrain features that 
are 4" or less in height as if they were not there.

CHAOS KNIGHTS – TRAITORIS LANCE
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Chaos Knights, you can use 
this Traitoris Lance Detachment rule.

FORGED IN TERROR (AURA)
Chaos Knights are servants of shadow and terror; 
wherever they stride, fear and madness spread. 

In the Battle-shock step of your opponent’s Command 
phase, if an enemy unit that is below its Starting 
Strength is within 12" of a Chaos Knights model 
from your army, that enemy unit must take a Battle-
shock test. For the purposes of this ability, if a unit 
has a Starting Strength of 1, it is considered to be 
below its Starting Strength while it has lost one or 
more wounds.

Designer’s Note: This means that all enemy units 
within range of this Aura ability that have lost one or 
more models must take a Battle-shock test in your 
opponent’s Command phase, not just those that are 
Below Half-strength.

CHAOS KNIGHTS – TRAITORIS LANCE
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Traitoris Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Traitoris Lance Enhancements. 
LORD OF DREAD
This tyrannical Knight is the epitome of dread power, 
instilling as much fear in their minions as they do over 
the enemy, ensuring unwavering obedience.

THE TRAITOR’S MARK
The dark deeds and bloodstained heraldry of this 
Chaos Knight are whispered far and wide. Rumours 
spread that to confront it is to face a painful death. 
Each blazon borne upon its hull proclaims the unholy 
atrocities committed by the bearer, and even to look 
upon these loathsome sigils is to be gripped by 
unnatural terror and beset by swarming nightmares.

Chaos Knights model only. At the start of the 
Fight phase, you can select one enemy unit within 
Engagement Range of the bearer; that enemy unit 
must take a Battle-shock test.
AURA OF TERROR
This towering Knight is wreathed in tendrils of warp 
energy that caress the minds of any enemy who 
draws near, driving those touched into a state of 
abject fear. Wherever this Knight treads, this aura of 
terror permeates and corrupts the land until it can 
be cleansed.

Chaos Knights model only. If you control an 
objective marker at the end of your Command phase, 
and the bearer is within range of that objective 
marker, that objective marker is said to be Tainted 
and remains under your control even if you have no 
models within range of it, until your opponent controls 
it at the start or end of any turn. In addition, while an 
objective marker is Tainted and under your control 
and the Despair Dread ability is active for your army, 
that objective marker has the Despair Dread ability as 
if it was a Chaos Knights model from your army (so 
subtract 1 from Battle-shock and Leadership tests 
taken for enemy units within 12" of it).

Chaos Knights model only. The Doom and Darkness 
ability is active for the bearer from the first battle 
round onwards, instead of from the third. 
PANOPLY OF THE CURSED KNIGHTS
Borne within an unmarked casket by an order of 
silent Idolators, this collection of tattered pennants, 
chain-strung charms and armour scraps represent 
the last remains of the Knight Carnivus Grymm. It 
is said that festooning one’s Knight suit with these 
charms instils the legendary fortitude of that doomed 
war engine. Yet it is whispered that doing so also 
invites the attentions of the same dread curse that 
eventually led to Carnivus Grymm’s ghastly end.

Chaos Knights model only. Each time an attack is 
made against the bearer, subtract 1 from the Armour 
Penetration characteristic of that attack.

 

CHAOS KNIGHTS – TRAITORIS LANCE
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Traitoris Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Traitoris Lance Stratagems. 

1CP

DREAD HOUNDS
TRAITORIS LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

War Dog pilots encircle their terrified 
victims then attack in a ferocious mass.

WHEN: The start of your Shooting phase or 
the start of the Fight phase.
TARGET: Two or more War Dog units from 
your army and one enemy unit that is an 
eligible target for each of those selected 
War Dog units.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
the selected War Dog units can only 
target that enemy unit, but all weapons 
equipped by those War Dog models gain 
the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability. In addition, 
if that enemy unit is Battle-shocked, until 
the end of the phase, each time a selected 
War Dog model makes an attack against 
that enemy unit, an unmodified Hit roll of 
5+ scores a Critical Hit.

1CP

PTERRORSHADES
TRAITORIS LANCE – WARGEAR STRATAGEM

Shrieking with ghoulish hunger, daemonic 
entities descend in a tatterwinged 
whirlwind to rend apart the souls of those 
enemies who show even a moment’s fear. 
The soul-raptors tear apart their victims’ 
animus and, as they feed, this life force 
is channelled to regenerate the battle 
damage or heal the pilot of the Knight in 
which these creatures roost.

WHEN: Any phase, just after an enemy 
unit fails a Battle-shock test.
TARGET: One Chaos Knights unit from 
your army that is within 12" of that 
enemy unit.
EFFECT: Roll six D6. For each 4+, that 
enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound and 
this model regains up to 1 lost wound. 

DISDAIN FOR THE WEAK
TRAITORIS LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

Chaos Knight pilots refuse to yield while 
foes remain to be slain, disdainfully 
ignoring those who succumb to fear.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Chaos Knights unit from 
your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your 
model has the Feel No Pain 6+ ability, and 
the Feel No Pain 5+ ability against attacks 
made by Battle-shocked models.

Ectoplasmic blood surges hot through 
glowing conduits as the Chaos Knight 
feeds power to its shield emitters.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has selected 
its targets.
TARGET: One Chaos Knights unit from 
your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
that Chaos Knights model has a 4+ 
invulnerable save against ranged attacks.

1CP

1CP

A LONG LEASH
TRAITORIS LANCE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The War Dogs of the Chaos Knights are 
more terrified of their lords than they 
are the enemy, and they heed their 
masters well, for they know the price of 
disobedience or disloyalty.

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Abhorrent model from your 
army and up to three War Dog models 
from your army.
EFFECT: Until the start of your next 
Command phase, those War Dog models 
count as being within range of any Aura 
abilities that Abhorrent model has.

KNIGHTS OF SHADE
TRAITORIS LANCE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Like dark phantoms, some Chaos 
Knights can move through solid walls 
without hindrance.

WHEN: Your Movement phase or your 
Charge phase.
TARGET: Up to two War Dog models from 
your army or one Titanic Chaos Knights 
model from your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, the 
selected models can move horizontally 
through models and terrain features as if 
they were not there.
