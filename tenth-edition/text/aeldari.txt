AELDARI
ARMY RULE

The Aeldari live on the brink of extinction. As such, their Farseers have 
become adept at reading future events, seeing the many strands of fate 
ahead of their people and the consequences of following each one. Taken at 
the right time, a simple action can avoid calamitous outcomes, aiding the 
Aeldari in their continued struggle for survival.

STRANDS OF FATE
If your Army Faction is Aeldari, at the start of the 
battle, make a Strands of Fate roll by rolling twelve D6. 

If you wish, you can then re-roll all of these dice, but 
if you do, roll one less D6. You can continue re-rolling 
all of the dice in this manner, rolling one less D6 each 
time you do, until you are satisfied with the results 
rolled (or until you only have a single D6 remaining). 

When you are satisfied with the results rolled, those 
remaining dice become your Fate dice for the battle. 
These results cannot be changed or re-rolled further, 
unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your 
Fate dice to one side – this is your Fate dice pool.

Before making a dice roll for a model or unit from your 
army with the Strands of Fate ability, if you have one 
or more dice in your Fate dice pool, you can use one 
of those Fate dice. To do so, select one of those Fate 
dice to substitute that dice roll. The dice that is being 
substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the 
selected Fate dice is used as if it had been rolled (this 
counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all 
rules purposes). Each Fate dice can only be used in 
this way once. After using a Fate dice, remove it from 
your Fate dice pool and roll all remaining dice that are 
part of that dice roll (if any). You can use Fate dice for 
any of the following types of dice roll:

 ■ Advance roll
 ■ Battle-shock test
 ■ Charge roll
 ■ Damage roll
 ■ Hit roll
 ■ Saving throw
 ■ Wound roll

AELDARI – BATTLE HOST
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Aeldari, you can use this 
Battle Host Detachment rule.

UNPARALLELED FORESIGHT
When the Aeldari take to the battlefield, any who 
oppose them are left confounded by their grace, 
elegance and martial skill. Where lesser beings would 
falter, the Aeldari move with a surety of purpose that 
can only be perceived as preordained. 

Each time an Aeldari unit from your army is 
selected to shoot or fight, you can re-roll one Hit roll 
and you can re-roll one Wound roll when resolving 
those attacks.

CORSAIRS AND TRAVELLING PLAYERS
The Dark City is frequented by ruthless 
mercenaries and nomadic warriors from other 
strands of the ancient race. Troupes of Harlequins 
and piratical bands of Corsairs accompany 
many Drukhari raids, free from constrictive paths 
to pursue profits and fated agendas across 
the galaxy.

If your Army Faction is Drukhari, you can include 
Harlequins and Anhrathe units in your army, 
even though they do not have the Drukhari 
Faction keyword. The combined points value of 
Harlequins and/or Anhrathe units you can 
include in your army depends on the battle size, 
as follows:

 ■ Incursion: Up to 250 pts
 ■ Strike Force: Up to 500 pts
 ■ Onslaught: Up to 750 pts

No Harlequins or Anhrathe models included in 
your army in this way can be your Warlord, and 
they cannot be given Enhancements.

YNNARI
Yvraine is a divider as much as a unifier amongst 
the Aeldari race, drawing both hatred and 
admiration. To some once-allies she and her ideals 
have become an immovable rift, yet between 
some once-enemies her influence has sewn 
bonds of fellowship once thought impossible.

If your Army Faction is Aeldari and your Warlord 
is Yvraine, you can include Drukhari units in 
your army, even though they do not have the 
Aeldari Faction keyword. The combined points 
value of such units you can include in your army 
depends on the battle size, as follows:

 ■ Incursion: Up to 500 pts
 ■ Strike Force: Up to 1000 pts
 ■ Onslaught: Up to 1500 pts

No Drukhari models included in your army in 
this way can be given Enhancements. You cannot 
include units with any of the following keywords 
in your army using these rules: Phoenix Lords; 
Anhrathe; Avatar of Khaine; Solitaire; 
Haemonculus Covens.

AELDARI – BATTLE HOST
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Battle Host Detachment rule, you can use these Battle Host Enhancements.
READER OF THE RUNES
THE PHOENIX GEM
Using their prescience to discern the enemy 
At the height of the War in Heaven, Isha drew down

the heat of a hundred stars into a glittering gem to 
save Asuryan. It is said that the Phoenix Gem is the

only surviving fragment of this ancient stone, and still 
retains the power to return life to the fallen.

Aeldari model only. The first time the bearer is 
destroyed, roll one D6: on a 2+, keep it to one side. At 
the end of the phase, set the bearer back up again, 
as close as possible to its previous position and not 
within Engagement Range of any enemy models, with 
its full wounds remaining.
THE WEEPING STONES
Carved from psychoactive rubies, these runic stones 
resemble the beads of blood that drip from the 
hand of Khaine. In battle, these stones rearrange 
themselves, revealing elements of the future.

Aeldari model only. Each time the bearer’s unit 
destroys an enemy unit, roll one D6 and add it to your 
Fate dice pool displaying the result you just rolled.

Aeldari Psyker model only. In your Command phase, 
you can select one dice in your Fate dice pool, re-roll 
it, then add it back to your Fate dice pool displaying 
the result you just rolled.
FATE’S MESSENGER
The strands of fate coil and twist around this warrior, 
the paths of destiny manipulated to keep them from 
harm so that they might strike back at their foes.

Aeldari model only. Once per turn, just after making 
a Hit roll, a Wound roll or a saving throw for a model 
in the bearer’s unit, you can treat the result as an 
unmodified roll of 6 instead.

AELDARI – BATTLE HOST
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Battle Host Detachment rule, you can use these Battle Host Stratagems.

1CP

1CP

FEIGNED RETREAT
BATTLE HOST – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The Aeldari are forever elusive, and their 
actions are unpredictable and deceptive. 
What appears to be a full retreat one 
moment is revealed as the prelude to a 
devastating attack the next.

WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after 
an Aeldari unit from your army makes a 
Fall Back move. 
TARGET: That Aeldari unit.
EFFECT: Your unit is eligible to shoot and 
declare a charge this turn even though it 
Fell Back.

MATCHLESS AGILITY
BATTLE HOST – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Grace in battle and merciless efficiency 
are prized virtues in craftworld armies. 
Like the shimmering blades of Khaine, 
the Asuryani carve through the ranks of 
their enemies.

WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Aeldari unit from your 
army that has not been selected to move 
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, if your 
unit Advances, do not make an Advance 
roll for it. Instead, until the end of the 
phase, add 6" to the Move characteristic 
of models in your unit.

2CP

1CP

FIRE AND FADE
BATTLE HOST – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The Aeldari are masters of hit-and-run 
tactics, engaging a target with a flurry of 
shots before quickly manoeuvring into 
cover or out of sight.

WHEN: End of your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Aeldari unit from your army.
EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal 
move. It cannot embark within a 
Transport at the end of this move.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select an 
Aircraft unit or a unit within Engagement 
Range of one or more enemy units, and 
until the end of the turn, the unit you 
selected is not eligible to declare a charge.

BLADESTORM
BATTLE HOST – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The well-trained Aeldari are able to lay 
down a hail of fire from their weapons, 
their superior reflexes allowing them to 
track even the most sudden movement 
and place every shot perfectly.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Aeldari unit from your 
army that has not been selected to shoot 
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes an 
attack, on a Critical Wound, improve the 
Armour Penetration characteristic of that 
attack by 2.

AELDARI – BATTLE HOST
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Battle Host Detachment rule, you can use these Battle Host Stratagems.

PHANTASM
BATTLE HOST – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

The Aeldari are masters of misdirection, 
and they employ holo-emitters and psychic 
phantasms to fool enemy scouts.

1CP

WHEN: End of your opponent’s 
Movement phase.

EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal 
move of up to 7". It cannot embark within 
a Transport at the end of this move.

within Engagement Range of one or more 
enemy units, and until the end of the turn, 
you cannot target that unit with the Heroic 
Intervention Stratagem.

LIGHTNING-FAST REACTIONS
BATTLE HOST – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The Aeldari can process battlefield 
events at baffling speed, making their 
physical reactions so fast that they are 
able to dodge attacks that would hit any 
other target.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Aeldari unit from your army 
(excluding Wraith Construct units) that 
was selected as the target of one or more 
of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, subtract 
1 from the Hit roll.

The prism cannon of this vehicle is the bane of heavy battle tanks. In 
its firing process, a laser is discharged into a massive crystal prism 
that amplifies the shot’s potency. The energy is released in one of two 
ways – either as thin lances of light to destroy the toughest vehicles, 
or as a dispersed pulse to slaughter swathes of infantry.
