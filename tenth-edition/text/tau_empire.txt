  T’AU EMPIRE
ARMY RULE

The Hunter Cadres battle for the betterment of 
the T’au Empire, not for personal gain or egotistic 
accomplishments. This burning commitment allows 
for prodigiously effective covering fire. Enemies are 
pinned in place by deadly bursts of pulse blasts, 
or the infamous T’au markerlight is used to expose 
even well-fortified enemy positions, allowing other 
T’au warriors to fall on the vulnerable enemies with 
murderous force.

FOR THE GREATER GOOD
If your Army Faction is T’au Empire, then in your 
Shooting phase units from your army can work in 
pairs to help each other target specific enemy units. 
When they do this, one unit is the Observer unit and 
the other is their Guided unit. The enemy they are 
targeting is called their Spotted unit.

Each time you select this unit to shoot, if it is not an 
Observer unit, it can use this ability. If it does, select 
one other friendly unit with this ability that is also 
eligible to shoot (excluding Fortification, Battle-
shocked and Observer units). Until the end of 
the phase, this unit is considered a Guided 
unit, and that friendly unit is considered an 
Observer unit. Then select one enemy unit 
that is visible to both your units to be their 
Spotted unit.

Until the end of the phase:

 ■  Each time a model in a Guided unit makes 

an attack that targets their Spotted unit, 
improve the Ballistic Skill characteristic of 
the attack by 1 and, if their Observer unit 
has the Markerlight keyword, the attack 
has the [IGNORES COVER] ability.

 ■  Each time a model in a Guided unit makes an 
attack that does not target their Spotted unit, 
worsen the Ballistic Skill characteristic of the attack 
by 1.

T’AU EMPIRE – KAUYON
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is T’au Empire, you can use this 
Kauyon Detachment rule.

RESTRICTIONS
 ■  If your army includes any Ethereal units, it cannot 

include a Commander Farsight model.

 ■  If your army includes a Commander Farsight 

model, it cannot include any Ethereal units.

KAUYON
The tactical philosophy known as the Kauyon allows 
for T’au commanders to draw the enemy into a deadly 
trap, springing it at the prefect moment to deliver a 
storm of fatal strikes against which none can escape.

From the third battle round onwards, all ranged 
weapons equipped by T’au Empire models from your 
army have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability. While a unit is 
a Guided unit (see For the Greater Good), weapons in 
that unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 2] ability instead.

T’AU EMPIRE – KAUYON
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Kauyon Detachment rule, you can use these Kauyon Stratagems. 

STIMM INJECTORS
KAUYON – WARGEAR STRATAGEM

This system injects the battlesuit pilot with 
a measured dose of chemical stimulants 
intended to temporarily accelerate their 
physical aptitude and pain tolerances.

1CP

1CP

2CP

WHEN: Fight phase or your opponent’s 
Shooting phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One T’au Empire Battlesuit 
unit from your army that was selected as 
the target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
models in your unit have the 
Feel No Pain 6+ ability.

STRIKE AND FADE

KAUYON – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

T’au are experts at harrying and 
outmanoeuvring their foes, bleeding them 
with accurate fire before fading away into 
the shadows and luring the foe into a trap.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One T’au Empire Battlesuit 
unit from your army that can Fly whose 
attacks have been resolved this phase.
EFFECT: If your unit is not within 
Engagement Range of any enemy units, it 
can make a Normal move. If it does, your 
unit cannot declare a charge this turn.

1CP

COORDINATE TO ENGAGE
KAUYON – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

T’au combined arms groups are called 
Hunter Cadres for good reason. Working in 
close coordination, they hunt and destroy 
the most dangerous enemy targets.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One T’au Empire unit from your 
army that has just been selected as an 
Observer unit (see For the Greater Good).
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes an attack 
that targets their Spotted unit, improve 
the Ballistic Skill characteristic of that 
attack by 1 and, if your unit has the 
Markerlight keyword, that attack has 
the [IGNORES COVER] ability.

POINT-BLANK AMBUSH

KAUYON – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The Kauyon teaches to lure the enemy 
into deadly point-blank ambushes.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase. 
TARGET: One T’au Empire unit from your 
army that has not been selected to shoot 
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes a ranged 
attack that targets an enemy unit within 
9", improve the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of that attack by 1.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot use this 
Stratagem during the first or second 
battle rounds.

T’AU EMPIRE – KAUYON 
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Kauyon Detachment rule, you can use these Kauyon Stratagems. 

1CP

2CP1CP

PHOTON GRENADES
KAUYON – WARGEAR STRATAGEM

Hurling a volley of photon grenades, the 
T’au leave their enemies dazzled and 
disorientated, unable to close the distance 
into combat at a crucial moment.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Charge phase, 
just after an enemy unit has declared 
a charge.
TARGET: One T’au Empire Grenades unit 
from your army that was selected as one 
of the targets of that charge.
EFFECT: That enemy unit must 
immediately take a Battle-shock test, and 
until the end of the phase, subtract 2 from 
Charge rolls made for that enemy unit.

COMBAT EMBARKATION
KAUYON – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Those who act as the lure in the 
Kauyon must be ready to make a hasty 
withdrawal once the enemy closes into 
killing range, lest they be trapped.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Charge phase, 
just after an enemy unit has declared 
a charge.
TARGET: One T’au Empire Infantry unit 
from your army that was selected as one 
of the targets of that charge, and one 
friendly Transport.
EFFECT: Your unit can embark within that 
Transport. If it does, your opponent can 
select new targets for that charge.
RESTRICTIONS: Every model in your T’au 
Empire Infantry unit must be within 
3" of that Transport and there must be 
sufficient transport capacity to embark 
the entire unit.

T’AU EMPIRE – KAUYON
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Kauyon Detachment rule, you can use these Kauyon Enhancements. 
EXEMPLAR OF THE KAUYON
Long meditation upon the tenets of the Patient Hunter 
has seen this warrior master the application of this 
cunning ambush strategy. When they take to the 
battlefield, they embody the teachings of the Kauyon, 
much to the dismay of their luckless prey.

T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper 
models). While the bearer is leading a unit, that unit’s  
Kauyon Detachment rule takes effect from the second 
battle round onwards instead of the third. 
PRECISION OF THE PATIENT HUNTER
This warrior prowls the battlefield like a high-tech 
predator, stalking and assessing their quarry before 
they strike. When they do launch their assault, 
their every shot and blow is informed by careful 
observations, perfectly aimed where they will do the 
greatest harm.

T’au Empire model only. Each time the bearer makes 
a ranged attack, add 1 to the Hit roll. From the third 
battle round onwards, add 1 to the Wound roll as well.

PURETIDE ENGRAM NEUROCHIP
Commander Puretide was undoubtedly the most 
gifted T’au war leader of all time. The T’au were 
unwilling to lose his tactical and strategic brilliance, 
and upon his death, his mind was scanned and his 
accumulated memories committed to a holostorage 
personality unit on his birth world of Dal’yth. A sliver 
of that genius has been crafted into a neurochip. 
When surgically implanted into the brain of a Fire 
Caste Commander, the bearer can access much of 
the wisdom of Puretide himself, drawing upon a great 
reservoir of tactical acumen.

T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper 
models). Once per turn, you can use a Stratagem on 
the bearer’s unit, even if you have already used that 
Stratagem on a different unit this phase.
THROUGH UNITY, DEVASTATION
Having studied every nuance of the art of applied 
mass-firepower, this warrior has mastered its 
deployment. Under their calm tutelage and stern 
gaze, warriors of the Fire Caste maximise every shot 
they fire, creating a blizzard of deadly-accurate 
energy that can pick apart even the most heavily 
armoured targets.

T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper 
models). While this model is leading a unit, each 
time that unit is an Observer unit, until the end of 
the phase, ranged weapons equipped by models in 
their Guided unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability while 
targeting their Spotted unit.

T’AU EMPIRE
DRONES

If you have upgraded a model to have a drone, place a Drone token next to your model as a reminder. These do 
not count as models for any rules purposes.

GUARDIAN DRONE 
Each time a model makes a ranged attack that 
targets the bearer’s unit, subtract 1 from the 
Wound roll.
