TYRANIDS
ARMY RULES

SYNAPSE
Some Tyranids serve as synaptic conduits or nodal 
relays through which a portion of the Hive Mind’s 
iron will flows, overriding the natural instincts of the 
swarm to direct the teeming warrior-beasts to function 
as a single, gestalt organism on the battlefield. 

If your Army Faction is Tyranids, while a Tyranids 
unit from your army is within 6" of one or more 
Synapse models from your army, that unit is said to 
be within Synapse Range of your army. Each time a 
Tyranids unit from your army takes a Battle-shock 
test, if it is within Synapse Range of your army, take 
that test on 3D6 instead of 2D6.

SHADOW IN THE WARP
Tyranids flood the battlefield with the psychic 
signature of the hive fleet, an icy, alien dread that 
gnaws at the minds of their prey and smothers even 
the most stalwart courage. When faced with such 
unfathomable horror, many are driven insane or suffer 
catastrophic neural damage.

If your Army Faction is Tyranids, once per battle, in 
either player’s Command phase, if one or more units 
from your army with this ability are on the battlefield, 
you can unleash the Shadow in the Warp. When you 
do, each enemy unit on the battlefield must take a 
Battle-shock test. 

TYRANIDS – INVASION FLEET
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Tyranids, you can use this 
Invasion Fleet Detachment rule. 

HYPER-ADAPTATIONS
Every warrior organism in the Tyranid race is 
fashioned by the ineffable alien will of the Hive Mind. 
Their flesh and chitin is endlessly mutable, honed into 
whatever form will prove most lethal to the prey.

At the start of the first battle round, select one of the 
following Hyper-adaptations to be active for Tyranids 
units from your army until the end of the battle:

 SWARMING INSTINCTS 
Each time a Tyranids model with this 
Hyper-adaptation makes an attack that targets an 
enemy Infantry or Swarm unit, that attack has the 
[SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

 HYPER-AGGRESSION 
Each time a Tyranids model with this 
Hyper-adaptation makes an attack that targets an 
enemy Monster or Vehicle unit, that attack has the 
[LETHAL HITS] ability.

 HIVE PREDATORS 
Each time a Tyranids model with this 
Hyper-adaptation makes an attack that targets an 
enemy Character unit, if a Critical Hit is scored, that 
attack has the [PRECISION] ability.

TYRANIDS – INVASION FLEET
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Invasion Fleet Detachment rule, you can use these Invasion Fleet Stratagems.

1CP

1CP

RAPID REGENERATION
INVASION FLEET – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Prey stare in horror as chitinous 
armour regrows and flesh, muscle and 
sinew knots back together as though 
never harmed.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Tyranids unit from your 
army that was selected as the target of 
one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
models in your unit have the 
Feel No Pain 6+ ability. If your unit is 
within Synapse Range of your army, until 
the end of the phase, models in your unit 
have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability instead.

DEATH FRENZY
INVASION FLEET – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Tyranids care nothing for self-
preservation, lashing out even in death.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Tyranids unit from your 
army that was selected as the target of 
one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if 
that model has not fought this phase, roll 
one D6: on a 4+, do not remove it from 
play. The destroyed model can fight after 
the attacking model’s unit has finished 
making attacks, and is then removed 
from play.

2CP

1CP

ADRENAL SURGE
INVASION FLEET – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

These warrior organisms destroy all as 
their adrenaline surges.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: Up to two Tyranids units from 
your army that are within Synapse Range 
of your army and are eligible to fight, or 
one other Tyranids unit from your army 
that is eligible to fight.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in one of those selected 
units makes an attack, a successful 
unmodified Hit roll of 5+ scores a 
Critical Hit.

OVERRUN
INVASION FLEET – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Tyranids are an unstoppable avalanche of 
flesh and chitin.

WHEN: Fight phase, just before a Tyranids 
unit from your army Consolidates.
TARGET: That Tyranids unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
each time a model in your unit makes a 
Consolidation move, it can move up to 
6" instead of up to 3", provided your unit 
can end its Consolidation move in Unit 
Coherency and within Engagement Range 
of one or more enemy units. If your unit 
is within Synapse Range of your army 
and not within Engagement Range of 
any enemy units, instead of making that 
Consolidation move, it can instead make a 
Normal move of up to 6".

TYRANIDS – INVASION FLEET
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Invasion Fleet Detachment rule, you can use these Invasion Fleet Stratagems.

1CP

ENDLESS SWARM
INVASION FLEET – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

As the battle rages, more organisms pour 
in to bolster the swarms.

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: Up to two Endless Multitude 
units from your army that are within 
Synapse Range of your army, or one other 
Endless Multitude unit from your army.
EFFECT: Up to D3+3 destroyed models are 
returned to each of the selected units.

1CP

SYNAPTIC INSIGHT
INVASION FLEET – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Guided by the instincts of leader-beasts, 
a portion of the swarm can be tasked with 
focusing its hunting instincts to destroy a 
particular foe.

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: Up to two Tyranids units from 
your army that are within Synapse Range 
of your army, or one other Tyranids unit 
from your army.
EFFECT: Select one Hyper-adaptation. 
Until the end of the battle round, that 
hyper-adaptation is active for those 
selected units in addition to any other that 
may be active for your army.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select the 
same hyper-adaptation you selected at 
the start of the first battle round.

TYRANIDS – INVASION FLEET
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Invasion Fleet Detachment rule, you can use these Invasion Fleet Enhancements.
ALIEN CUNNING
This leader-beast possesses highly sophisticated 
neural pathways, allowing it to identify priority 
strategic assets and adapt the position of its 
warriors to seize them before the foe even recognise 
their value.

SYNAPTIC LINCHPIN
With a cerebral cortex that pulsates with the 
irresistible power of the Hive Mind, this leader acts as 
a blazing synaptic beacon to the lesser creatures of 
the swarm, the better to direct their actions and react 
to the ever-changing state of battle.

Tyranids model only. After both players have 
deployed their armies, select up to three Tyranids 
units from your army and redeploy them. When doing 
so, you can set those units up in Strategic Reserves if 
you wish, regardless of how many units are already in 
Strategic Reserves.
PERFECTLY ADAPTED
This creature was created for one purpose: to 
completely eradicate the defenders of the target 
prey world.

Tyranids model only. Once per turn, you can re-roll 
one Hit roll, one Wound roll, one Damage roll, one 
Advance roll, one Charge roll or one saving throw 
made for the bearer.

Tyranids model only. While a friendly Tyranids unit 
is within 9" of the bearer, that unit is within Synapse 
Range of your army.
ADAPTIVE BIOLOGY
The same weapon rarely works against this 
leader-beast twice, as its alien physiology adapts at 
an astonishing rate to counter the attacks of the foe.

Tyranids model only. The bearer has the Feel No Pain 
5+ ability. At the start of any turn, if the bearer has 
fewer than its starting number of wounds remaining, 
until the end of the battle, it has the Feel No Pain 4+ 
ability instead.

Parasitic Infection: Each time an Infantry model is 
destroyed by an attack made with this model’s barbed 
ovipositor, after this model has finished making its attacks, 
you can add one new Ripper Swarms unit to your army 
consisting of D3 models and set it up within 3" of this model. 
If you do, that Ripper Swarms unit can be set up within 
Engagement Range of the destroyed model’s unit (but not 
within Engagement Range of any other enemy units).
It Itches!: At the start of the Fight phase, select one enemy 
unit within Engagement Range of this model. That enemy unit 
must take a Battle-shock test.

They are able to eject shoals of Mucolid Spores, while prey who 
stray too close are subjected to hails of organic projectiles from the 
bio-cannons grafted to the Sporocyst’s hide.

PSYCHOPHAGE
These monsters stampede into battle with frightening speed. They 
devour any prey organism in their paths, but especially favour those 
victims with psychic abilities. How they metabolise such esoteric 
powers is unclear, but doing so allows them to project surges of 
psychocorrosive ash that deflagrate their victims’ minds and souls.

FACTION: Synapse

Disruption Bombardment: In your Shooting phase, after 
this unit has shot, if an enemy Infantry unit was hit by one 
or more of those attacks made by this unit’s bio-cannons, 
until the end of your opponent’s next turn, that enemy unit is

characteristic, and subtract 2 from Advance and Charge rolls 
made for it.

BARBGAUNTS
Barbgaunts are little more than living weapons, their bodies and 
bio-cannons slaved to the will of a pulsating ganglio-parasite that 
piggybacks them into battle. There, they unleash volleys of chitinous 
barbs that detonate with the fury of violent muscle-spasms and 
transfix nearby victims with hails of jagged projectiles.
