DRUKHARI
ARMY RULE

The Drukhari are experts in precise torture, sharp blades, cruel poisons and eldritch abominations. Using the 
labyrinthine network of webway spars, they strike almost anywhere. Realspace raiding parties prey upon worlds 
across the galaxy, surging from hidden portals unknown to those they see merely as cattle or playthings. As the 
Drukhari feed on the souls of the slain, they become imbued with supernatural might, eventually turning into 
killing machines.

POWER FROM PAIN
If your Army Faction is Drukhari, units from your army with this ability can become Empowered Through Pain. 
This is done using Pain tokens.

GAINING PAIN TOKENS
 If your Army Faction is Drukhari, you gain Pain 
tokens as follows:

 ■   At the start of the battle, depending on the 

battle size:  

COMBAT PATROL

INCURSION

STRIKE FORCE

ONSLAUGHT

1 PAIN TOKEN

2 PAIN TOKENS

3 PAIN TOKENS

4 PAIN TOKENS

 ■  Each time an enemy unit is destroyed, you gain 1 

Pain token.

 ■  Each time an enemy unit fails a Battle-shock test, 

you gain 1 Pain token.

Each time you gain a Pain token, keep it to one side – 
this is your Pain token pool.

EMPOWERED THROUGH PAIN
At the start of any phase, you can expend one or more 
Pain tokens from your Pain token pool. Each time you 
do, select one unit from your army with the Power 
from Pain ability. Until the end of the phase, that unit 
is Empowered, and gains the abilities listed below, 
depending on the phase.

 OR 

 ■  Empowered in the Movement or Charge phase:

 ◦  You can re-roll Advance or Charge rolls made for 

that unit.

 OR 

 ■ Empowered in the Shooting or Fight phase:

 ◦  Each time a model in that unit makes an attack, 

you can re-roll the Hit roll.

DRUKHARI – REALSPACE RAIDERS
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Drukhari, you can use this 
Realspace Raiders Detachment rule.

REALSPACE RAIDERS
The three factions of the Drukhari are constantly 
vying for supremacy, each convinced beyond 
doubt of their own innate superiority. This struggle 
manifests during their realspace raids as a frenzy of 
murderously sadistic competition.

At the start of the battle, you gain an additional 1 Pain 
token for each of the following your army contains:

 ■ One or more Archon models
 ■ One or more Succubus models
 ■ One or more Haemonculus models

Designer’s Note: These are all cumulative, so if 
your army contains at least one Archon, at least 
one Succubus and at least one Haemonculus, 
you would start the battle with an additional 3 
Pain tokens.

DRUKHARI – REALSPACE RAIDERS
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Realspace Raiders Detachment rule, you can use these Realspace Raiders Stratagems. 

ACROBATIC DISPLAY
REALSPACE RAIDERS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Many Wych Cults favour spectacular 
gymnastic displays. Their fighters are 
never still, springing from one foot to the 
other at blinding speed.

WHEN: Your Charge phase.
TARGET: One Wych Cult unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your 
unit is eligible to declare a charge even if it 
Fell Back or Advanced this turn. 

PREY ON THE WEAK
 REALSPACE RAIDERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

The scent of a foe in pain draws Drukhari 
to it like hungry predators to an injured 
beast, their senses sharpening at its tang.

1CP

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Kabal unit from your 
army and one enemy unit that is 
Below Half-strength.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes an attack 
that targets that enemy unit, you can 
re-roll the Wound roll. 

STRIKE AND FADE
REALSPACE RAIDERS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

The Drukhari are masters at using 
hit-and-run tactics, engaging a target 
with a flurry of shots before quickly 
manoeuvring into cover or out of sight.

WHEN: End of your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Drukhari unit from your 
army (excluding Aircraft).
EFFECT: Your unit can immediately make a 
Normal move. 
RESTRICTIONS: Until the end of the turn, 
your unit is not eligible to declare a charge 
and that unit cannot embark within a 
Transport at the end of this move.

2CP

DRUKHARI – REALSPACE RAIDERS
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Realspace Raiders Detachment rule, you can use these Realspace Raiders Stratagems. 

1CP

INSENSIBLE TO PAIN
REALSPACE RAIDERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The twisted creations of the Haemonculus 
Covens are insensible to all but the most 
mortal injuries.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Haemonculus Covens unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, subtract 
1 from the Wound roll.

1CP1CP

1CP

ALLIANCE OF AGONY
REALSPACE RAIDERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Even the most bloodthirsty Drukhari 
will veil their enmity to work together 
against a shared enemy for the same 
gruesome purpose.

WHEN: Start of any phase. 
TARGET: One Archon, one Succubus and 
one Haemonculus from your army.
EFFECT: Discard one Pain token from 
your Pain token pool. Until the end of the 
phase, all three of those models’ units 
are Empowered. 
RESTRICTIONS: You can only use this 
Stratagem if you are able to select all 
three of the target models stated above. 

QUICKSILVER REACTIONS

REALSPACE RAIDERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The hyper-fast reflexes of the Drukhari 
allow them to duck and weave to avoid all 
but the swiftest enemy strikes.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Drukhari unit from your 
army that was selected as the target of 
one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack that targets your unit, 
subtract 1 from the Hit roll.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot target a 
Haemonculus Covens unit from your 
army for this Stratagem. 

DRUKHARI – REALSPACE RAIDERS
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Realspace Raiders Detachment rule, you can use these Realspace Raiders Enhancements. 
CRUCIBLE OF MALEDICTION
When opened, the souls of tortured psykers spew 
outward, driving any nearby warp-wielders insane.

BLOOD DANCER
This Succubus is renowned for their expertise 
at close-quarters combat within the arenas of 
Commorragh. The skills they display before the 
baying crowds on the blood-soaked sands are 
equally deadly on the battlefield.

Haemonculus model only. Once per battle, at the 
start of any Shooting phase, the bearer can use this 
Enhancement. When it does, every enemy unit within 
12" must take a Battle-shock test, subtracting 1 from 
that test if the bearer’s unit is currently Empowered. 
Each time a Psyker unit fails this test, it suffers D3 
mortal wounds. 
LABYRINTHINE CUNNING
This Archon has a mind like steel traps, assimilating 
every detail of a situation.

Archon model only. Each time you select the bearer’s 
unit as the target of a Stratagem, roll one D6, adding 3 
to the result if the Stratagem being used is Alliance of 
Agony: on a 4+, you gain 1CP. 

Succubus model only. Improve the Attacks and 
Armour Penetration characteristics of the bearer’s 
melee weapons by 1. While the bearer is Empowered, 
Improve the Attacks and Armour Penetration 
characteristics of the bearer’s melee weapons by 
2 instead.
THE ART OF PAIN
Some Drukhari elevate their battle plans to another 
level by creating a spectacle of torment that maims 
and cripples every foe in order to draw out the 
moment of the kill, heightening the pleasure they 
derive before the fatal blow falls.

Drukhari model only. In your Command phase, if the 
bearer is on the battlefield, you gain 1 Pain token.

Raw speed delivers countless light Venom transports to the heart 
of the enemy’s defence, and sees them chase down stragglers and 
encircle the foe’s outriders. For the clique of warriors on board, Venoms 
are mobile firebases and gore-splashed chariots in one, with flickering 
shields that confound attempts to bring them down.

WARGEAR OPTIONS
 ■   This model’s twin splinter rifle can be replaced with 1 splinter cannon.

UNIT COMPOSITION
 ■ 1 Venom
This model is equipped with: splinter cannon; twin splinter 
rifle; bladevanes.

TRANSPORT

This model has a transport capacity of 6 Drukhari Infantry 
models. This model cannot transport Grotesque models or 
models that can Fly. 
Before the battle, at the start of the Declare Battle Formations 
step, you can select one Kabalite Warriors or Wyches unit 
from your army. If you do, that unit is split into two units, each 
containing as equal a number of models as possible (when 
splitting a unit in this way, make a note of which models form 
each of the two new units). One of these units must start the 
battle embarked within this Transport; the other can start 
the battle embarked within another Transport, or it can be 
deployed as a separate unit.

VOIDRAVEN BOMBER
Mounting some of the most powerful guns in the Drukhari arsenal, the 
Voidraven Bomber’s dark scythes and void lances can crack heavily 
armoured targets. Yet they pale against the silent aircraft’s primary 
weapon – the void mine. Once this arcane payload is deployed, the 
resulting darklight implosion erases all caught within its blast.

 ■ The model’s 2 void lances can be replaced with 2 dark scythes.

UNIT COMPOSITION

bio-weapons with which they inflict maximum agony.

their incredible arena skills to slay with precision and élan. They wield 
exotic weapons – hooks, barbed chains or flensing blades – that 
require superior ability. These are deadly in Wyches’ hands as they 
dart, twist and blur around their foes’ clumsy attacks.
