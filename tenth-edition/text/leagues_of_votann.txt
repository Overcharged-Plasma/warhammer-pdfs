LEAGUES OF VOTANN
ARMY RULE

The Kin are a highly practical people in every area of life, not least in war. Their leaders make swift and careful 
calculations before and during battle, constantly striving to determine if the potential reward of conflict is worth 
the inevitable loss of resources and precious Kin lives. An essential part of this is what is known as casting the 
Eye of the Ancestors, through which Kin commanders assess the greatest enemy threats, mark weak points in 
their defences and determine what forces are needed to overcome both.

EYE OF THE ANCESTORS
If your Army Faction is Leagues of Votann, each time 
an enemy unit destroys a Leagues of Votann unit 
from your army, that enemy unit gains 1 Judgement 
token. An enemy unit can never have more than 2 
Judgement tokens (any further Judgement tokens a 
unit would gain beyond this are ignored).

Each time a model from your army with this ability 
makes an attack that targets a unit that has one or 
more Judgement tokens, until that model’s attacks 
have been resolved, apply the relevant bonus from 
the table below to that attack.

JUDGEMENT  

TOKENS

BONUS

1

2

Eminent Threat: Add 1 to the Hit roll.

Now We’ve Got a Grudge to Settle: 
Add 1 to the Hit roll and add 1 to the 
Wound roll.

Designer’s Note: If a unit with Judgement tokens is 
removed from the battlefield, make a note of how 
many Judgement tokens it had when it was removed. 
If that unit is set up on the battlefield again, place 
the corresponding number of Judgement tokens next 
to it. If a unit with Judgement tokens splits up into 
two or more smaller units, each of those units gains 
a number of Judgement tokens equal to that of the 
original unit. If two units combine to form a single 
larger unit and either of those units had Judgement 
tokens, make a note of how many the unit with the 
most has, just before they combine – the new unit 
has a number of Judgement tokens equal to this.

LEAGUES OF VOTANN – OATHBAND
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Leagues of Votann, you can 
use this Oathband Detachment rule.

RUTHLESS EFFICIENCY
The Kin of an Oathband are skilled warriors and 
ruthless expansionists, instinctively working together 
to defeat their foes and efficiently achieve their aims. 
As with everything, they approach war with a grim, 
methodical pragmatism that is an inspiration to 
other Kin.

At the start of the battle, select one unit from your 
opponent’s army. That unit starts the battle with 2 
Judgement tokens (see Eye of the Ancestors). 

If, at the start of any of your Command phases, that 
enemy unit is destroyed, you gain a number of CP 
depending on how early in the battle you destroyed 
it, as shown below (you can only gain CP in this way 
once per battle, and CP gained in this way are an 
exemption to the Core Rules that limit the maximum 
number of CP you can gain per battle round to 1).

Unit destroyed by the start of your first or second 
Command phase:

You gain  

3CP

Unit destroyed by the start of your third or fourth 
Command phase:

You gain 

Unit destroyed by the start of your fifth 
Command phase:

You gain  

2CP

1CP

STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Oathband Detachment rule, you can use these Oathband Stratagems.

1CP

1CP

WARRIOR PRIDE
OATHBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The warriors of the Leagues of Votann 
pride themselves on their martial skill 
and proficiency in combat, and when the 
Ancestors are watching their actions they 
can quickly overwhelm and pick apart 
their foes.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Leagues of Votann unit 
from your army, and one enemy unit 
that has one or more Judgement tokens 
and is within Engagement Range of that 
Leagues of Votann unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
each time a model in your unit makes 
a melee attack that targets that enemy 
unit, improve the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of that attack by 1 for each 
Judgement token that enemy unit has.

ORDERED RETREAT
OATHBAND – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Not for the Kin the sudden panic of the 
rout. Instead, they fall back steadily 
and by squads, laying down furious 
suppressing fire before launching 
fresh assaults.

WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after a 
Leagues of Votann unit from your army 
Falls Back.
TARGET: That Leagues of Votann unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit 
is eligible to shoot and declare a charge.

1CP

ANCESTRAL SENTENCE
OATHBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Some foes are so loathed that the 
Ancestors themselves are said to pass 
sentence upon them, marking them 
for death.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Leagues of Votann unit 
from your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
each time a model in your unit makes 
a ranged attack, that attack has the 
[SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability, and each time 
a model in your unit makes a ranged 
attack that targets a unit that has one or 
more Judgement tokens, that attack has 
the [SUSTAINED HITS 2] ability instead.

REACTIVE REPRISAL

OATHBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

2CP

Once an enemy target has been marked out 
by the Eye of the Ancestors, the Kin focus their 
efforts upon its destruction, redoubling their 
fury should it attempt to engage.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, just 
after an enemy unit that has one or more 
Judgement tokens has resolved its attacks.
TARGET: One Leagues of Votann unit from 
your army that was selected as the target of 
one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your Leagues of Votann unit can 
shoot as if it were your Shooting phase, but it 
must target the enemy unit that just attacked 
it, and can only do so if that enemy unit is an 
eligible target.

LEAGUES OF VOTANN – OATHBAND
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Oathband Detachment rule, you can use these Oathband Stratagems.

1CP

NEWFOUND NEMESIS
OATHBAND – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

To strike down Kin is to earn the 
immediate and murderous ire of all their 
warrior comrades.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has resolved its attacks.
TARGET: One Leagues of Votann 
Infantry or Leagues of Votann 
Mounted unit from your army that was 
reduced to Below Half-strength as a result 
of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: The attacking unit gains 1 
Judgement token, or up to 2 Judgement 
tokens instead if that Leagues of Votann 
unit contained your Warlord when it was 
targeted by those attacks.

1CP

VOID ARMOUR
OATHBAND – WARGEAR STRATAGEM

Void armour comprises hardened, 
jointed segments hooked into the 
void suit beneath. It is fashioned from 
magnaferrite weave, and often reinforced 
with adamantine and enhanced with 
microfield generators.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Leagues of Votann unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your Leagues 
of Votann unit, worsen the Armour 
Penteration characteristic of that attack 
by 1.

LEAGUES OF VOTANN – OATHBAND
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Oathband Detachment rule, you can use these Oathband Enhancements.
APPRAISING GLARE
Few Kin can cast the Eye of the Ancestors with the 
swiftness and grim efficiency of this venerable leader. 
Where their merciless gaze falls, the strengths and 
weaknesses of the enemy are laid bare, and there 
their warriors strike hardest.

GRIM DEMEANOUR
This warlord’s grim countenance is legendary, and 
they are rumoured to have never smiled. Such a 
demeanour is, of course, an outward sign of how 
seriously they undertake their solemn tasks, and 
under their stern gaze no Kin will be found wanting.

Leagues of Votann model only. In your Command 
phase, you can select one objective marker your 
opponent controls. Until the end of the phase, while 
an enemy unit is within range of that objective marker, 
it counts as having one more Judgement token than it 
actually has (to a maximum of 2).
A LONG LIST
This warrior holds the majority of the galaxy’s races 
in contempt, and seeks out their many nemeses with 
a keen and inescapable eye. No sooner have they 
settled a Grudge against one foe, than they move to 
the next name on their list.

Leagues of Votann model only. Each time the 
bearer’s unit destroys an enemy unit, if that enemy 
unit has one or more Judgement tokens, you can 
select one other enemy unit that is visible to the 
bearer. That other unit gains one Judgement token.

Leagues of Votann model only. You can re-roll 
Battle-shock tests taken for the bearer’s unit, and 
models in that unit can ignore any or all modifiers to 
their characteristics and/or to any rolls or tests made 
for them (excluding modifiers to saving throws).
WAYFARER’S GRACE
This one-of-a-kind void suit was crafted for the 
famed Hernkyn adventurer Sîmmka Farstryd as 
thanks for her saving the Hold world of Hyvôk’s 
Kindred. Incorporating ancient technological secrets 
interpreted from Votannic lore, Wayfarer’s Grace acts 
as a life-support system for its wearer. Monitoring 
their vital statistics constantly, the suit provides 
medical support and can even restart its wearer’s 
stopped heart in extremis.

Leagues of Votann model only. The first time the 
bearer is destroyed, after placing a Judgement token 
next to the unit that destroyed it, roll one D6 at the 
end of the phase. On a 2+, set the bearer back up on 
the battlefield as close as possible to where it was 
destroyed and not within Engagement Range of any 
enemy units, with its full wounds remaining.

Cyberstimms: Each time a model in this unit is destroyed by 
a melee attack, if that model has not fought this phase, roll 
one D6: on a 4+, do not remove it from play. The destroyed 
model can fight after the attacking model’s unit has finished 
making its attacks, and is then removed from play.
Subterranean Explosives: In your Shooting phase, after this 
unit has shot, select one enemy unit (excluding Monsters 
and Vehicles) that was hit by one or more of this unit’s 
mole grenade launchers this phase and roll one D6. On a 4+, 
until the end of your opponent’s next turn, that enemy unit 
is shaken. While a unit is shaken, subtract 2" from its Move 
characteristic and subtract 2 from Advance and Charge rolls 
made for it.
Designer’s Note: While a unit is shaken, place a Mole Grenade 
token next to that unit as a reminder.

Cthonian Beserks are amongst the most heavily augmented and 
courageous Kin. Brandishing mining-tools-cum-weapons-of-war and 
unleashing explosives that tunnel through solid rock, the Beserks 
storm the enemy’s strongpoints and break them open like an asteroid 
filled with seams of precious ore.
