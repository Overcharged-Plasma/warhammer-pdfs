ADEPTUS ASTARTES
ARMY RULES

In battle, Space Marines swear mighty oaths to destroy the enemies of the Emperor and uphold the honour of 
their Chapter, and such vows are sacrosanct. When the Angels of Death strike, they do so with the precision of a 
surgeon and the force of a thunderbolt. Experience and strategic expertise help them to read the shifting shape 
of the battle with post-human speed and clarity, directing their wrath towards one priority target after another. 
Command assets are annihilated, leaving the enemy reeling leaderless. Heavy armour, potent artillery and the 
vaunted elites of the foe’s forces are laid waste with horrifying speed, until the Emperor’s Angels of Death stand 
victorious over a field of smouldering wreckage and bolt-riddled corpses, and honour is finally satisfied.

OATH OF MOMENT
If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, at the 
start of your Command phase, select one unit from 
your opponent’s army. Until the start of your next 
Command phase, each time a model from your army 
with this ability makes an attack that targets that 
enemy unit, you can re-roll the Hit roll and you can 
re-roll the Wound roll.

SPACE MARINE CHAPTERS
 ■  If an Adeptus Astartes unit has a second 

Faction keyword on its datasheet, that 
Faction keyword is the name of that unit’s 
Chapter. For example, Marneus Calgar 
has both the Adeptus Astartes and 
Ultramarines Faction keywords, and is 
therefore from the Ultramarines Chapter.
 ■  You cannot include units from more than 

one Chapter in your army. 

ADEPTUS ASTARTES – GLADIUS TASK FORCE
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can use 
this Gladius Task Force Detachment rule.

COMBAT DOCTRINES
The Codex Astartes has proven its worth as a superb 
treatise on warfare over countless battlefields, and 
has remained so even after ten thousand years. Many 
Space Marines hold its wisdom in awe, and exemplify 
its teachings, employing a flexible set of combat 
doctrines to eliminate their enemy. Few opponents 
can withstand the fury of such an onslaught. 

At the start of your Command phase, you can 
select one of the Combat Doctrines listed below. 
Until the start of your next Command phase, that 
Combat Doctrine is active and its effects apply 
to all Adeptus Astartes units from your army 
with this ability. You can only select each Combat 
Doctrine once per battle.

DEVASTATOR DOCTRINE
The Codex Astartes explains in detail the strategic value 
of overwhelming firepower applied to key targets while 
advancing into position in order to eliminate threats and 
create tactical openings.

This unit is eligible to shoot in a turn in which it Advanced.

TACTICAL DOCTRINE
As the warring armies close upon one another and 
vicious fire-fights erupt, the Codex lays out strategies for 
swiftly seizing the initiative and combining versatility 
with firepower.

This unit is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a turn 
in which it Fell Back.

ASSAULT DOCTRINE
The Codex Astartes leaves no doubt that the killing blow 
in most engagements must be delivered with a decisive 
close-quarters strike. It presents plentiful tactical means 
to achieve this end.

This unit is eligible to declare a charge in a turn in which 
it Advanced.

ADEPTUS ASTARTES – GLADIUS TASK FORCE
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Gladius Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Gladius Task Force Stratagems.

ONLY IN DEATH DOES DUTY END

ARMOUR OF CONTEMPT

GLADIUS TASK FORCE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

GLADIUS TASK FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

The belligerency of the Adeptus Astartes, 
combined with their transhuman 
physiology, makes them unyielding foes 
to face.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, worsen 
the Armour Penetration characteristic of 
that attack by 1.

2CP

Imminent death does not prevent a Space 
Marine from enacting his final justice 
upon the enemies of the Imperium.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if 
that model has not fought this phase, do 
not remove it from play. The destroyed 
model can fight after the attacking 
model’s unit has finished making its 
attacks, and is then removed from play.

HONOUR THE CHAPTER

GLADIUS TASK FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

Every Chapter has forged its own tales of 
heroism, and none of its battle-brothers 
would see that noble record besmirched.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, melee 
weapons equipped by models in your unit 
have the [LANCE] ability. If your unit is 
under the effects of the Assault Doctrine, 
until the end of the phase, improve the 
Armour Penetration characteristic of such 
weapons by 1 as well.

ADAPTIVE STRATEGY

SQUAD TACTICS

GLADIUS TASK FORCE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

GLADIUS TASK FORCE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Space Marines know precisely when 
to give ground in order to leave their 
enemies floundering, before surging back 
into the fight and driving them from the 
field in disarray.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Movement phase, 
just after an enemy unit ends a Normal, 
Advance or Fall Back move.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes Infantry 
or Adeptus Astartes Mounted unit from 
your army that is within 9" of the enemy 
unit that just ended that move.
EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal 
move of up to D6", or a Normal move of up 
to 6" instead if it is under the effects of the 
Tactical Doctrine.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select a unit 
that is within Engagement Range of one or 
more enemy units.

1CP

1CP

The tenets of the Codex Astartes allow for 
unorthodox use of combat tactics and 
the employment of divergent strategic 
doctrines if doing so will lead to victory.

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Select the Devastator Doctrine, 
Tactical Doctrine or Assault Doctrine. Until 
the start of your next Command phase, 
that Combat Doctrine is active for that unit 
instead of any other Combat Doctrine that 
is active for your army, even if you have 
already selected that doctrine this battle. 

STORM OF FIRE

GLADIUS TASK FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

There is no escaping the wrath of the 
Space Marines, and they use their 
weapons to bring swift death to their foes 
wherever they may hide, expertly placing 
their shots to wreak maximum damage.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, ranged 
weapons equipped by models in your 
unit have the [IGNORES COVER] ability. 
If your unit is under the effects of the 
Devastator Doctrine, until the end of the 
phase, improve the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of such weapons by 1 
as well. 

ADEPTUS ASTARTES – GLADIUS TASK FORCE
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Gladius Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Gladius Task Force Enhancements.
ARTIFICER ARMOUR
Crafted by the finest artificers of the Chapter, these 
ornately detailed suits of armour provide superior 
protective capabilities that rival even Terminator 
plate. All who set eyes upon the wearer know that 
an honoured champion of the Imperium stands 
before them.

ADEPT OF THE CODEX
The commanders of Space Marine strike forces 
epitomise the tactical genius of the Codex Astartes, 
its wisdom guiding them to measured strategic 
responses even amidst the fiercest flames of battle.

Adeptus Astartes model only. The bearer has a Save 
characteristic of 2+ and the Feel No Pain 5+ ability. 
THE HONOUR VEHEMENT
A single stanza of script, the original of which was 
said to have been penned by the Emperor himself, 
the Honour Vehement is inscribed on thrice-blessed 
parchment and affixed with a purity seal upon its 
bearer’s weaponry. So potent is the inspirational 
value of the Emperor’s own evocation that those who 
bear it are driven to heroic acts of martial prowess.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Add 1 to the Attacks 
and Strength characteristics of the bearer’s melee 
weapons. While the bearer is under the effects 
of the Assault Doctrine, add 2 to the Attacks and 
Strength characteristics of the bearer’s melee 
weapons instead.

Captain model only. At the start of your Command 
phase, if the bearer is on the battlefield, instead of 
selecting a Combat Doctrine to be active for your 
army, you can select the Tactical Doctrine. If you do, 
until the start of your next Command phase, that 
doctrine is active for the bearer’s unit only, even if you 
have already selected that doctrine to be active for 
your army this battle.
BOLTER DISCIPLINE
To a Space Marine, the boltgun is more than a weapon 
– it is an instrument of Mankind’s divinity, the bringer 
of death to his foes. This commander has drilled his 
warriors relentlessly, and when combined with the 
Adeptus Astartes’ superhuman reflexes, his warriors 
can produce a devastating rate of fire.

Adeptus Astartes model only. While the bearer is 
leading a unit, ranged weapons equipped by models 
in that unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability. In 
addition, while the bearer’s unit is under the effects of 
the Devastator Doctrine, each time a model in that unit 
makes a ranged attack, a successful unmodified Hit 
roll of 5+ scores a Critical Hit.

In brutal urban combat, it can be impossible to root out entrenched 
foes. Not so for the Land Raider Redeemer. When it engages its

optimised for escorting Stormraven Gunships. While fast enough 
to engage in aerial combat, its pilot can switch on the Stormtalon’s 
repulsor systems, making it agile enough to closely support infantry 
in defence or on the attack.
