GENESTEALER CULTS
ARMY RULE

Genestealer Cults keep their fighting strength carefully hidden from their oppressors until the glorious Day of 
Ascension arrives. When they finally emerge to fight, it is after long years of meticulous planning, and with an 
intimate knowledge of the battlefield that grants them a tactical advantage. Even as battle rages, reinforcements 
slip from the shadows or spill up from the dark places below, called to war by the Broodmind.

BROOD BROTHERS
Through cunning and unholy good fortune, a 
Genestealer Cult can send its questing tendrils 
writhing into even the highest ranks of the 
military forces that should be standing guard 
against it. So does the Patriarch seize new and 
potent weapons of revolution.

If your Army Faction is Genestealer Cults, 
you can include Astra Militarum units in 
your army, even though they do not have the 
Genestealer Cults Faction keyword.The 
combined points cost of Astra Militarum units 
you can include in your army depends on your 
battle size, as follows:

 ■ Incursion: Up to 250 pts
 ■ Strike Force: Up to 500 pts
 ■ Onslaught: Up to 750 pts

No Astra Militarum models in your army 
can be your Warlord, and they cannot be 
given Enhancements. You cannot include units 
with any of the following keywords in your 
army using these rules: Epic Hero; Ogryn; 
Ratling; Militarum Tempestus; Commissar; 
Regimental Preacher; Regimental 
Enginseer; Munitorum Servitors; Aircraft. 

CULT AMBUSH
If your Army Faction is Genestealer Cults, each time 
a unit with this ability is destroyed, roll one D6, adding 
3 to the result if it is a Battleline unit. On a 4+, that 
unit is placed into Cult Ambush and you can place 
one Cult Ambush marker* anywhere on the battlefield 
that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy 
units (if this is not possible, no marker is placed).

If an enemy model (excluding Aircraft models) ends 
any kind of move within 9" of a Cult Ambush marker 
you placed, that Cult Ambush marker is removed 
from the battlefield. At the end of the Reinforcements 
step of your opponent’s next Movement phase, for 
each of your Cult Ambush markers that is still on 
the battlefield, you can select one unit from your 
army that is in Cult Ambush and set that destroyed 
unit back up on the battlefield using the Deep Strike 
ability, containing all of its models with their full 
wounds remaining and with at least one of those 
models touching that Cult Ambush marker (that Cult 
Ambush marker is then removed from the battlefield). 

Characters that are attached to a unit with this 
ability are not returned alongside that unit should it 
return to the battlefield as described above (only the 
Bodyguard unit returns).

Designer’s Note: Each time a unit with this ability is 
destroyed, it triggers all rules that apply when a unit 
is destroyed. For example, if a rule awards a player 
1VP each time an enemy unit is destroyed, and a 
unit with this ability is destroyed, returned using this 
ability then subsequently destroyed again, it would 
award the opponent 2VP. 

*  A circular 32mm diameter marker should be used for 
Cult Ambush Markers.

GENESTEALER CULTS – ASCENSION DAY
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Genestealer Cults, you can 
use this Ascension Day Detachment rule.

THEY CAME FROM BELOW
For generations an insidious threat has lain hidden 
within the shadows. Now their time is nigh, and from 
out of the tunnels and sewers they rise to topple 
their oppressors in brutally violent insurrection. 
None can escape the sudden ambushes that herald 
the Day of Ascension! 

Each time a Genestealer Cults unit from 
your army is set up on the battlefield as 
Reinforcements, until the end of your next 
Fight phase, weapons equipped by models 
in that unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] and 
[IGNORES COVER] abilities.

UNQUESTIONING LOYALTY
ASCENSION DAY – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Broodkin are so fanatically loyal that they 
do not hesitate to sacrifice themselves to 
protect their leaders.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Genestealer Cults 
Character unit from your army that was 
selected as the target of one or more of 
that enemy unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a Character model in your unit 
would lose a wound, select one friendly 
Genestealer Cults unit within 3" of it 
(excluding Vehicle units). Your Character 
model does not lost that wound and 
that selected unit suffers one mortal 
wound instead.

COORDINATED TRAP
ASCENSION DAY – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Flowing like a dark tide down hidden 
tunnels, along rubble-choked gulleys or 
through sagging and rusted vents, the

WHEN: The start of your Shooting phase or 
the start of the Fight phase.
TARGET: Two Genestealer Cults units 
from your army that have not been 
selected to shoot or fight this phase, and 
one enemy unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in either of your units makes 
an attack, it can only target that enemy 
unit (and only if it is an eligible target 
for that attack), and when resolving that 
attack, add 1 to the Wound roll.

TUNNEL CRAWLERS
ASCENSION DAY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Squirming, crawling and scrabbling 
through confined spaces is second nature 
to many broodkin, and is a skill they 
use to assail seemingly impregnable 
enemy positions.

WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Genestealer Cults unit 
from your army that is arriving using the 
Deep Strike ability this phase.
EFFECT: Your unit can be set up anywhere 
on the battlefield that is more than 3" 
horizontally away from all enemy models.
RESTRICTIONS: A unit targeted by this 
Stratagem is not eligible to declare a 
charge in the same turn.

A PERFECT AMBUSH
ASCENSION DAY – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

These Cultists have tracked their enemies 
tirelessly, as predatory beasts stalk their 
prey. Only when their position is perfect do 
they strike, engulfing their victims in a hail 
of unexpected firepower. 

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Genestealer Cults unit 
from your army that arrived from Reserves 
this turn and has not been selected to 
shoot this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
improve the Ballistic Skill and Armour 
Penetration characteristics of ranged 
weapons equipped by models in your 
unit by 1.

TARGET: One Genestealer Cults 
Infantry unit from your army that was 
selected as the target of one or more of 
that enemy unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your 
unit has the Stealth ability and can only 
be selected as the target of a ranged 
attack if the attacking model is within 12".

RETURN TO THE SHADOWS
ASCENSION DAY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Ever cunning and duplicitous, broods of 
the faithful often vanish back into tunnels 
and vents after their initial strike, ready to 
regroup and attack again elsewhere.

WHEN: End of your opponent’s turn.
TARGET: Up to two Genestealer Cults 
Battleline units from your army, or one 
other Genestealer Cults Infantry unit 
from your army. 
EFFECT: Remove the targeted units 
from the battlefield and place them into 
Strategic Reserves.

have the Deep Strike ability and cannot be 
within Engagement Range of any enemy 
units when targeted.

ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Ascension Day Detachment rule, you can use these Ascension Day Enhancements.
PROWLING AGITANT
No matter how often the oppressors seek to trap or 
silence this leader, they always find themselves 
left empty-handed and foolish, their elusive quarry 
long gone.

METICULOUS PLANNER
No other force spends as long laying meticulous 
preparations for the battles to come as the 
Genestealer Cults. Their plans to counter the foe are 
works of dark genius.

Genestealer Cults model only. Once per turn, when 
an enemy unit ends a Normal, Advance or Fall Back 
move within 9" of the bearer’s unit, if the bearer’s unit 
is not within Engagement Range of any enemy units, 
it can make a Normal move of up to D6". 
INSCRUTABLE CUNNING
Every variable has been factored into this strategist’s 
master plan. 

Genestealer Cults model only. While the bearer is 
leading a unit, models in that unit have the Infiltrators 
ability and each time you select that unit as the target 
of a Stratagem, roll one D6: on a 4+, you gain 1CP.

Genestealer Cults model only. Once per battle, just 
after your opponent uses a Stratagem, if the bearer is 
on the battlefield, it can use this ability. If it does, until 
the end of the battle, the CP cost your opponent must 
pay to use that Stratagem again is increased by 1CP.
FOCUS OF ADORATION
This warlord inspires such insane devotion that their 
minions will leap headlong into battle in order to win 
their favour.

Genestealer Cults model only. While the bearer is 
leading a unit, you can target that unit with the Heroic 
Intervention Stratagem for 0CP, and can do so even 
if you have already targeted a different unit with that 
Stratagem this phase.

ABILITIES

CORE: Deep Strike, Infiltrators, Lone Operative, Stealth

Primed and Ready: In your Shooting phase, you can select 
one model from your army with this ability as the target of 
the Grenade Stratagem for 0CP, provided that model has not 
already been the target of that Stratagem this phase. This can 
allow you to use the Grenade Stratagem for a second time 
this phase.
Planted Explosives: Once per battle, when an enemy unit 
ends a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move within 12" of 
this model, this model can use its Reductus mine. If it does, 
roll one D6: on a 2+, that enemy unit suffers D3+3 mortal 
wounds. Only one model from your army with this ability can 
use it in the same battle round.
Designer’s Note: Place a Reductus Mine token next to the 
model, removing it once this ability has been used.

REDUCTUS SABOTEUR
There is no engine of the oppressors that a Reductus Saboteur cannot 
lay low, and few materials they cannot fashion into a bomb given 
a little time to tinker. Flitting through the shadows, they lace the 
battlefield with booby traps and deploy powerful explosives that make 
short work of enemy armour.

allows it to strike down prey from afar.
