ORKS
ARMY RULE

The infamous war cry of the Orks is known and 
feared throughout the galaxy. When it echoes across 
the battlefield, bellowed from hundreds or even 
thousands of greenskin mouths, even the most 
stalwart warriors fear the onslaught to come.

WAAAGH!
If your Army Faction is Orks, once per battle, at the 
start of the battle round, you can call a Waaagh! If you 
do, until the start of the next battle round:

 ■  Orks units from your army are eligible to declare a 

charge in a turn in which they Advanced.

 ■  Add 1 to the Strength and Attacks characteristics 

of melee weapons equipped by Orks models from 
your army. 

 ■  Orks models from your army have a 5+ 

invulnerable save.

ORKS – WAAAGH! TRIBE
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Orks, you can use this 
Waaagh! Tribe Detachment rule.

GET STUCK IN
Once an Ork gets stuck into hand-to-hand combat, 
they quickly overwhelm their enemies through 
sheer ferocity.

Melee weapons equipped by Orks models from your 
army have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

ORKS – WAAAGH! TRIBE
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Waaagh! Tribe Detachment rule, you can use these Waaagh! Tribe Stratagems.

1CP

CAREEN!
WAAAGH! TRIBE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

If their vehicle is on its last legs, any Ork 
worth their steering wheel will aim its 
blazing remains into the nearest cluster 
of enemies. The ensuing explosions never 
fail to raise a rousing cheer from nearby 
Ork onlookers.

WHEN: Any phase, just after an Orks 
Vehicle unit from your army with the 
Deadly Demise ability is destroyed.
TARGET: That destroyed Orks Vehicle 
unit, if you roll a 6 for its Deadly Demise 
ability. You can use this Stratagem on that 
unit even though it was just destroyed.
EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal or 
Fall Back move before its Deadly Demise 
ability is resolved, and before any 
embarked units perform an Emergency 
Disembarkation. When making this move, 
your unit can move over enemy units 
(excluding Monsters and Vehicles) as if 
they were not there.

ORKS IS NEVER BEATEN
WAAAGH! TRIBE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

2CP

So resilient is Ork physiology – and so 
slow are Orks on the uptake – that even 
killing wounds can take a while to register.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Orks unit from your army 
that was selected as the target of one or 
more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if 
that model has not fought this phase, do 
not remove it from play. The destroyed 
model can fight after the attacking 
model’s unit has finished making attacks, 
and is then removed from play.

UNBRIDLED CARNAGE

WAAAGH! TRIBE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

When Orks get stuck into the foe, the 
carnage is wonderful to behold, at least 
for other Orks.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Orks unit from your army 
that has not been selected to fight 
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an Orks model in your unit makes a 
melee attack, an unmodified hit roll of 5+ 
scores a Critical Hit.

ORKS – WAAAGH! TRIBE

If you are using the Waaagh! Tribe Detachment rule, you can use these Waaagh! Tribe Stratagems.

’ARD AS NAILS
WAAAGH! TRIBE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

MOB RULE
WAAAGH! TRIBE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Even the lowliest Ork Boy can take a 
tremendous amount of punishment before 
being slain.

1CP

The more Orks that gather in one place the 
more the Waaagh! energy flows, and the 
more fearless they all become.

1CP

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Orks unit from your army 
that was selected as the target of one or 
more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, subtract 
1 from the Wound roll.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select 
a Vehicle or Gretchin unit for 
this Stratagem. 

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Mob unit from your army that 
contains 10 or more models and is not 
Below Half-strength.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, while 
a friendly Orks Infantry unit is within 6" 
of that Mob unit, that Orks Infantry unit 
can still be selected as the target of your 
Stratagems even if it is Battle-shocked.

’ERE WE GO
WAAAGH! TRIBE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

Even lumbering Orks can put on a 
surprising turn of speed when the promise 
of a good face-to-face fight is in the offing. 
Once a horde of Orks get a sight of the foe, 
nothing can stop them.

WHEN: Start of your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Orks Infantry unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, add 2 
to Advance and Charge rolls made for 
your unit.

ORKS – WAAAGH! TRIBE
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Waaagh! Tribe Detachment rule, you can use these Waaagh! Tribe Enhancements.
FOLLOW ME LADZ
Always found at the forefront of an assault, this Ork 
likes to be the first into the fray.

KUNNIN’ BUT BRUTAL
Feigning weakness, this greenskin allows his foes to 
close in before delivering a brutal flurry of attacks.

Orks model only. While the bearer is leading a 
unit, add 2" to the Move characteristic of models in 
that unit.
HEADWOPPA’S KILLCHOPPA
Grand Warboss Headwoppa and his tribe were last 
seen charging headlong into a horde of Khornate 
daemons, but legend speaks of a blood-slick choppa 
that still turns up occasionally. Though this weapon 
looks normal, a dark voice is said to growl in the mind 
of its wielder, driving them on to ever greater excesses 
of violence.

Orks model only. Melee weapons equipped by the 
bearer that do not have the [EXTRA ATTACKS] ability 
have the [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability.

Orks model only. While the bearer is leading a unit, 
that unit is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a 
turn in which it Fell Back.
SUPA-CYBORK BODY
The original owner of this one-of-a-kind endoskeleton 
became the envy of every Warboss around, and was 
soon gutted and stripped for parts by a stronger 
rival. The Supa-Cybork Body has been retransplanted 
several times since then, filling its new owner with 
confidence, resilience and a belated hope that the 
Painboyz gave it a quick clean before shoving it back 
in place… 

Orks model only. The bearer has the 
Feel No Pain 4+ ability.

Ork Boyz surge into battle in huge, unruly mobs dotted with crude 
special weapons and led by foul-tempered Boss Nobz. Most simply 
stampede towards the enemy lines, relying on their numbers and 
natural hardiness to carry the charge home, while others hitch a ride 
on Trukks and Battlewagons so as to get stuck in all the faster.

BURNA BOYZ
The burna is a cutting torch intended for slicing up battlefield 
wreckage. Serendipitously, it also works well when searing through 
an enemy’s armour at close quarters, or, with a twist of its nozzle, can 
instead belch a tongue of roaring flame over the foe. Needless to say, 
the most pyromaniacally inclined Orks delight in doing both.

Outcast Nobz pilot these lumbering war engines, following the echoing 
call of the Great Waaagh! out across the stars. They are welcomed by 
Ork warbands wherever they go, for the punishing hails of firepower 
they can unleash are devastating, and few foes can long survive the 
grasp of their enormous, piston-powered klaws.

Any Mekboy worth his spanners knows how to patch and repair 
greenskin vehicles, artillery pieces and the like even amidst the fury of 
combat. Meks are also handy for a spot of good old-fashioned dakka 
and close-quarters violence, taking to the field armed to the teeth with 
kustom weaponry that they invented themselves.

From guns that spew unstable force-bubbles to overcharged energy 
cannons, gravity beamers that crumple their targets like a squig-oil 
canister in a Nob’s fist to tractor-beams that toss foes about and drag 
planes from the air, the only unifying factor about the madcap Mek 
Gunz is what a mess they make of the foe.

STOMPA
Something akin to a bad-tempered, armour-plated mountain covered 
in guns, the Stompa is a walking idol to Gork and Mork. It packs 
enough firepower to level an enemy fortress or annihilate entire 
formations of troops with a single volley, while anything unlucky 
enough to get within reach is soon crushed flat.

Most Orks mock Stormboyz for their acts of juvenile rebellion, from 
taking orders and shining their boots to marching about, talking 
about ‘taktics’ and even following a battle plan. Yet when that plan is 
‘strap on a high powered rokkit and hurtle into the enemy bellowing 
“Waaagh!”’, it does prove to have its merits.
