GREY KNIGHTS
ARMY RULE

The soul of the Grey Knights is sacrosanct, and their purity is incorruptible. The silvered armour of this 
Chapter’s warriors is bound with incantations, engraved with sigils of warding. Their blades shine with the inner 
light of their sanctity, for each of these Space Marines is a psychic warrior, in empyric communion with his 
battle-brothers. Empowered by minds constantly on guard, they can cut steel with bare hands, their eyes blaze 
with fire and even the power of their words flays the otherworldly skin of daemons. They are the Imperium’s 
foremost sword and shield against the daemonic. Guided by the foresight and prophecies of the Chapter’s 
Prognosticars, a Grey Knight can adapt to the most irrational of foes and, in a flare of teleportation energies, 
emerge at exactly the right location to unleash their devastating power.

TELEPORT ASSAULT
If your Army Faction is Grey Knights, at the end of 
your opponent’s turn, you can select a number of 
Grey Knights units from your army with this ability 
(excluding units that are within Engagement Range 
of one or more enemy units). The maximum number 
of units you can select depends on the battle size, 
as follows:

COMBAT PATROL

INCURSION

STRIKE FORCE

ONSLAUGHT

UP TO 1 UNIT

UP TO 2 UNITS

UP TO 3 UNITS

UP TO 4 UNITS

Once you have made your selections, 
remove those units from the battlefield. In 
the Reinforcements step of your next 
Movement phase, set each of those 
units up anywhere on the battlefield 
that is more than 9" horizontally 
away from all enemy models. 
Any units that are not on 
the battlefield at the 
end of the battle count 
as destroyed.

GREY KNIGHTS – TELEPORT STRIKE FORCE
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Grey Knights, you can use 
this Teleport Strike Force Detachment rule.

TELEPORT SHUNT
Hardened against the corrupting touch of Chaos, 
protected by silver sigils and the warriors’ own purity 
of spirit, Grey Knights are capable of enduring rapid 
and repeated submersions in the warp. When a 
lightning-fast purgation is required, orbiting strike 
cruisers maintain a constant spiritual lock on their 
battle-brothers, enabling Grey Knights to perform 
short-ranged teleportations. Flickering in and out 
of reality, this exceptional mobility allows them to 
outmanoeuvre the most otherworldly of enemies.

Each time a Grey Knights unit with the Deep Strike 
ability Advances, do not make an Advance roll. 
Instead, until the end of the phase, add 6" to that 
unit’s Move characteristic and that unit can Fly.

GREY KNIGHTS – TELEPORT STRIKE FORCE
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Teleport Strike Force Detachment rule, you can use these Teleport Strike 
Force Enhancements.
FIRST TO THE FRAY
Whether braving premature teleportation assaults 
or leaping from the hatch of a transport still aglow 
from atmospheric entry, this sanctified commander 
frequently makes the first strike in battle, and ever 
from an unexpected quarter. Inspired by such zealous 
bravery, his battle-brothers are never far behind.

SIGIL OF EXIGENCE
Forged by the Techmarine Dorvel urThann, this 
small chor-bronze icon contains a powerful teleport 
matrix and a trio of vigilant machine spirits. Their 
pre-cogitative psyroutines guard against attacks 
from afar, spiriting their host and his allies away from 
danger in a blaze of light.

Grey Knights model with the Deep Strike ability only. 
The bearer’s unit must start the battle in Reserves, but 
neither it, nor any Transport it is embarked within, 
is counted towards any limits the mission places on 
the number of Strategic Reserves units you can have. 
That unit can be set up using its Deep Strike ability in 
the Reinforcements step of your first, second or third 
Movement phase, regardless of any mission rules.
DOMINA LIBER DAEMONICA
This tome is said to be a relic of Supreme Grand 
Master Janus, he who mastered all six hundred 
and sixty-six words of banishment, each one 
painstakingly recorded on its pages. In times of need 
a hero of the Chapter will carry this book into battle, 
its bindings crackling with arcane energy as the 
words repel warp entities and send daemons howling 
back into the warp.

Grey Knights model only. Each time the bearer 
makes a melee attack add 1 to the Wound roll and, 
if that attack targets a Daemon unit, add 1 to the 
Damage characteristic of that attack as well.

Grey Knights model only. Once per battle, in your 
opponent’s Shooting phase, when the bearer’s unit 
is selected as the target of a ranged attack, you can 
remove the bearer’s unit from the battlefield and then 
set it back up again anywhere on the battlefield that 
is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy 
models. If the bearer is no longer an eligible target, 
your opponent can then select new targets for any 
attacks that had targeted the bearer’s unit.
INESCAPABLE WRATH
When this warrior leads his battle-brothers into 
the foe, they strike like silver lances of lightning. 
By focusing his powers upon a pivotal moment, he 
connects himself via a tether of inevitability to his 
enemies. Drawn by the tether, he bears down upon 
them with incredible speed, ensuring none escape his 
and his warriors’ wrath.

Grey Knights model only. Add 1 to Charge rolls made 
for the bearer’s unit.

Librarians have a strength of mind greater even than many of the 
powerful battle-psykers with whom they fight. The breadth of their 
empyric scholarship is vast and they courageously brave the deeper 
and more dangerous reaches of the warp, using psychic rites to shield 
their fellows or tear at daemonic forms.

bolters is likened by its crew to the growl of its machine spirit.
