AGENTS OF THE IMPERIUM
ARMY RULE

Throughout the Imperium there exist numerous martial 
organisations and shadowy institutions. Bodies of armed 
warriors or solitary agents from these groups possess 
specialist skills, unusual equipment and vested interests 
that lead them to be attached to larger Imperial armies. 
Some are requisitioned by the army’s commander for their 
particular abilities, others are assigned by their hidden 
masters to achieve singular agendas. The most powerful 
have the authority and reputation to enforce their presence 
on the field of battle.

ASSIGNED AGENTS
If every model in your army has the Imperium keyword, 
you can include Agents of the Imperium units in your 
army even if they do not have the Faction keyword you 
selected in the Select Army Faction step. The maximum 
number of Agents of the Imperium units you can include 
in your army depends on the battle size, as shown below.
