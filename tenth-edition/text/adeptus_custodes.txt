ADEPTUS CUSTODES – SHIELD HOST
ARMY RULE

Created deep in the Emperor’s Palace using esoteric gene-
alchemies and other, even more mysterious processes, 
the warriors of the Adeptus Custodes are the Emperor’s 
personal bodyguards. Known as the Ten Thousand, they 
are the most elite warriors in the entire Imperium, and 
are armed and armoured to match. In battle, they deploy 
highly flexible fighting forces, from peerless infantry and 
lightning-fast jetbikes to indomitable combat walkers and 
line-shattering battle tanks. It is in melee combat that they 
truly excel, however, each warrior having mastered the 
nuanced and subtle fighting stances designed to dominate 
the Custodians’ many enemies.

MARTIAL KA’TAH
At the start of the Fight phase, select one Ka’tah Stance 
from the list below to be active for your army until the 
end of the phase. While a Ka’tah Stance is active for your 
army, each unit from your army with this ability gains the 
relevant ability.

KAPTARIS STANCE
Kaptaris is optimised to trap enemy units in close 
combat with the Custodes, where the elite warriors can 
eliminate them.

Each time a melee attack targets this unit, subtract 1 from 
the Hit roll.

DACATARAI STANCE
This aggressive fighting style has been adapted for 
the Custodes to deal with hordes of foes who vastly 
outnumber them. 

Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the 
[SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

RENDAX STANCE
Masters of Rendax are superlative monster and war-
machine hunters. 

Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the 
[LETHAL HITS] ability.

ADEPTUS CUSTODES – SHIELD HOST
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Custodes, you can 
use this Shield Host Detachment rule.

AEGIS OF THE EMPEROR
The cellular alchemy that creates the warriors of the 
Adeptus Custodes leaves them forever touched by a 
spark of the Emperor’s own greatness. Beyond their 
martial might and incorruptible nobility, this energy 
manifests itself as an almost supernatural warding, 
as though the Custodians were protected by the hand 
of the Emperor.

Adeptus Custodes models from your army have the 
Feel No Pain 4+ ability against mortal wounds.

ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Shield Host Detachment rule, you can use these Shield Host Enhancements.
UNSTOPPABLE DESTROYER
This warrior is implacable on the field, the Emperor’s 
will made manifest. No foe can hope to stop him 
achieving his goals, and those who stand before his 
battle fury see their death swiftly approaching.

VEILED BLADE
An ancient weapon that burns with a bitterly cold 
and dark energy, the Veiled Blade is bestowed upon 
a Custodian who has vowed to recover that which 
should remain hidden from Humanity, and return it to 
the Dark Cells.

 ■  Adeptus Custodes model only (excluding 

Anathema Psykana models). Each time the bearer 
ends a Charge move, select one enemy unit within 
Engagement Range of the bearer and roll one D6: on 
a 2-5, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds; on 
a 6, that enemy unit suffers 3 mortal wounds.

 ■  Once per battle, after the bearer’s unit ends a Charge 

move, all enemy units within 6" of the bearer must 
take a Battle-shock test.
INSPIRATIONAL EXEMPLAR
This warrior epitomises the martial genius of the 
Adeptus Custodes. His judgement is sound, his 
tactical acumen impeccable.

 ■  Adeptus Custodes model only (excluding 

Anathema Psykana models). The bearer has a 
Leadership characteristic of 5+.

 ■  Once per battle, at the start of any phase, you can 
select one friendly Adeptus Custodes unit that is 
Battle-shocked and within 12" of the bearer; that 
unit is no longer Battle-shocked. 

 ■  Adeptus Custodes model only (excluding 

Anathema Psykana models). Add 2 to the Attacks 
characteristic of the bearer’s melee weapons.

 ■  Once per battle, at the start of any Command phase, 

triple the bearer’s Objective Control characteristic 
until the end of the turn.
CEASELESS HUNTER
This warrior never relents in the pursuit of his quarry 
– any apparent withdrawal he makes merely brings 
death to his foe sooner.

 ■  Adeptus Custodes model only (excluding 

Anathema Psykana models). The bearer’s unit is 
eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a turn in 
which it Fell Back.

 ■  Once per battle, when an enemy unit ends a Normal, 

Advance or Fall Back move within 9" of the bearer, 
if the bearer’s unit is not within Engagement Range 
of one or more enemy units, it can make a Normal 
move of up to 6".
