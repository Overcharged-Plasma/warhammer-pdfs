BLOOD ANGELS – SONS OF SANGUINIUS
DETACHMENT RULE

Gene-sons of the angel-winged Primarch Sanguinius, the Blood Angels descend into battle on flaming wings to 
stand between the Emperor’s servants and the heretical and alien hordes that seek to destroy them. Masters 
of the rapid assault, the mechanised offensive and the swift airborne strike, they have carved out a legacy of 
victories that stretches across the ages.

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can 
use this Sons of Sanguinius Detachment rule.

RESTRICTIONS
 ■  Your army can include Blood Angels units, but it 
cannot include any Adeptus Astartes units drawn 
from any other Chapter.

THE RED THIRST
Though they strive to restrain it, the murderous 
ferocity of the Blood Angels simmers beneath the 
surface of their thoughts. In battle, this rage drives 
them towards the foe and lends great strength to 
their blows.

Each time an Adeptus Astartes unit from your 
army is selected to fight, if that unit made a Charge 
move this turn, until the end of the phase, add 1 to 
the Strength and Attacks characteristics of melee 
weapons equipped by models in that unit.

If you are using the Sons of Sanguinius Detachment rule, you can use these Sons of 
Sanguinius Stratagems.

1CP

1CP

ANGEL’S SACRIFICE
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

The Blood Angels would gladly put 
themselves in harm’s way to protect 
others, exemplifying the sacrifice 
of Sanguinius.

WHEN: Any phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes 
Character unit from your army that 
was just destroyed. You can use this 
Stratagem on that unit even though it was 
just destroyed.
EFFECT: Until the end of the battle, each 
time a friendly Adeptus Astartes unit 
makes an attack that targets the enemy 
unit that just destroyed your Character 
unit, you can re-roll the Hit roll.

ARMOUR OF CONTEMPT
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The belligerency of the Adeptus Astartes 
combined with their transhuman 
physiology makes them unyielding foes 
to face.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, worsen 
the Armour Penetration characteristic of 
that attack by 1.

AGGRESSIVE ONSLAUGHT
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

The Sons of Sanguinius constantly 
push towards new foes, the bloodlust 
singing in their veins unleashed in a 
controlled dynamism.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes 
unit from your army, just before that 
unit Consolidates.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
each time a model in your unit makes a 
Consolidation move, it can move up to 
6" instead of up to 3", provided your unit 
ends that Consolidation move in Unit 
Coherency and within Engagement Range 
of one or more enemy units.

RED RAMPAGE
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

In times of great desperation, fury and 
ferocity can be a warrior’s strongest allies.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
melee weapons equipped by models 
in your unit have the [LANCE] and 
[LETHAL HITS] abilities.

STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Sons of Sanguinius Detachment rule, you can use these Sons of 
Sanguinius Stratagems.

ONLY IN DEATH DOES DUTY END

SONS OF SANGUINIUS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

2CP

Imminent death does not prevent a Space 
Marine from enacting his final justice 
upon the enemies of the Imperium.

1CP

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if 
that model has not fought this phase, do 
not remove it from play. The destroyed 
model can fight after the attacking 
model’s unit has finished making its 
attacks, and is then removed from play.

RELENTLESS ASSAULT
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The Blood Angels are loathe to resort to 
the defensive strategies favoured by 
other Chapters, and a tactical withdrawal 
is but a prelude to re-entering the fray.

WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after 
an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army 
Falls Back.
TARGET: That Adeptus Astartes unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit 
is eligible to declare a charge even though 
it Fell Back this phase.

BLOOD ANGELS – SONS OF SANGUINIUS
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Sons of Sanguinius Detachment rule, you can use these Sons of Sanguinius Enhancements.
ARTISAN OF WAR
This warrior is a true artist both on and off the 
battlefield. His talents are reflected in the exquisite 
workmanship of his wargear, for he insists upon 
personally crafting his weapons of war.

ARCHANGEL’S SHARD
When Sanguinius battled Horus, his magnificent 
blade was tragically shattered against the 
Warmaster’s profane battle plate. The shards 
were gathered up and new swords forged to 
incorporate them, each one gifted to a different 
successor Chapter.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Improve the Armour 
Penetration characteristic of the bearer’s weapons by 
1, and the bearer has a Save characteristic of 2+.
VISAGE OF DEATH
This exquisitely crafted mask is a thing of dark beauty 
to the Blood Angels, and a sign of impending doom 
to their enemies. The unchanging expression of the 
mask inspires fear and uncertainty even in confident 
enemies. They see no anger, pain or elation on the 
wearer’s face – clues as to the warrior’s state of mind 
in a duel.

Adeptus Astartes model only. While an enemy 
unit (excluding Monsters and Vehicles) is within 
Engagement Range of the bearer’s unit, halve the 
Objective Control characteristic of models in that unit.

Adeptus Astartes model only. The bearer’s 
melee weapons have the [ANTI-CHAOS 5+] and  
[LANCE] abilities.
ICON OF THE ANGEL
Entrusted to one whose faith in the primogenitor is 
profound, the Icon of the Angel takes the form of a 
small shrine upon the bearer’s backpack. Through 
displaying it, this warrior reminds his brothers of the 
heretics who fled after laying low the Angel, exhorting 
them to let no enemy escape their grasp again.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Each time an enemy 
unit (excluding Monsters and Vehicles) within 
Engagement Range of the bearer’s unit is selected 
to Fall Back, models in that enemy unit must 
take Desperate Escape tests as if their unit was 
Battle-shocked. When doing so, if that enemy unit is 
also Battle-shocked by other means, subtract 1 from 
each of those Desperate Escape tests.
